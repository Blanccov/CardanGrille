The first of the mysterious sea disasters occurred in March, 1990.
It did not seem important; it was given very little publicity. A
small, old-fashioned freight vessel of some thirty thousand tons sank
in mid-Pacific with the loss of all on board. The ship, which in its
day must have been accounted a luxurious passenger liner, had, years
ago, been converted to the freight trade, and its weirdly elaborate
superstructure long since dismantled. Bound from San Francisco to
the Island ports and Dutch East India with a cargo of manufactured
foodstuffs for the eastern island markets, it had sunk unexpectedly,
and for no apparent cause, at fifteen N degrees and one hundred and
sixty-five degrees E, northwest of the Marshall Group.
