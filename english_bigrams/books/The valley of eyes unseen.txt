                               PROLOGUE


The tale begins in my rooms in Peking, in the north of China,
one bitter January morning many years ago. The scene is stamped
ineffaceably on my recollection, so that even without the help of
certain confirmatory details, such as the overturning of the coffee
pot, I am able to say with certainty that the hour of day was breakfast
time. The breakfast table was the central point of a triangle, formed
by the blazing fire in the grate and two ponderous oil stoves farther
out in the room; for this was in the punishing old days before that
gift of the gods, the steam-heated radiator, came to soften the arctic
rigours of a North China winter.

My number-one house boy had brought in the morning paper and laid it on
my table, but it was without any lively anticipation of delight that I
picked up the straw-blemished, hazily printed sheet. The local press
of the time was not of enthralling interest; and what news of the
outer world filtered through to our buried corner of Asia in erratic
dribbles was apt to be still further marred by the bold but not always
illuminating innovations of the Chinese compositors in setting English
type. I was idly turning over the spavined issue of this morning when
something caught my eye in the middle column of the middle page. A
moment later the sheet was fluttering to the floor, and a river of
boiling coffee sluiced out over the cloth of the breakfast table.

I picked up the fallen newspaper and began to read. The age-yellowed
sheet lies before me as I write, and the following, save for numerous
typographical errors which I have not copied, is an exact transcript of
the report that had given me this sudden start:--

                    "MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR IN SHANGHAI.

              "DISTINGUISHED ORIENTALIST DEAD, IS REPORT.

    "Our Shanghai correspondent writes: 'Mr. Ronald Mirlees, the
    well-known author, was discovered dead in the Marco Polo Hotel of
    this city, this morning about eight o'clock, under circumstances of
    considerable mystery. The deceased was well known to the management
    and staff, having frequently stayed at Marco Polo before, in
    the intervals between his journeys to other localities of China
    on research work. It is believed he had just returned from one
    such expedition three months back, when he took possession of
    the two first-storey rooms he was occupying at the time of his
    death. Mr. Mirlees lived apparently much alone, hotel servants
    state, remaining busy at work in his apartment all day and barely
    desisting from his labours to take meals which were brought up to
    him; indeed, house boy whose duty it was to attend to Mr. Mirlees
    alleges that more than once he found the scholar at work in the
    early morning, his bed not slept in; from which it is assumed at
    the hotel that Mirlees was for some reason or other working against
    time to complete one of those contributions to oriental research
    with which his name has become associated.

    "'When house boy entered Mr. Mirlees' apartment this morning he
    found deceased at his writing desk apparently deep in composition.
    Deceased's back was turned to the door, and not until the servant
    had asked Mr. Mirlees what time to serve breakfast and received no
    reply that he suspected anything was untoward. Then he approached
    and saw. The boy becoming terror-stricken screamed for help, and
    other servants rushed in, followed by Mr. Alexis Delabre (Manager,
    Marco Polo Hotel), who overheard the boy's cries. Medical aid was
    at once summoned, but quite unavailing, death having apparently
    supervened several hours before as muscles of deceased were already
    set fast in _rigor mortis_. Witnesses one and all lay especial
    emphasis on gruesome nature of the discovery. The body, they
    allege, was placed in so natural and lifelike an attitude that
    until spectators had come right across the apartment and looked
    from that side they were unable to credit they were looking upon a
    corpse. Expression on features of dead man is stated to have been
    one of extreme horror, not pain--witnesses are unanimous upon that
    point--but sheer and unmistakable horror. Mr. Mirlees held a pen
    in one hand and there were sheets of paper before him, but no mark
    upon them. There, in fact, lies another mysterious feature of the
    case. No trace can be found of the voluminous writings upon which
    Mr. Mirlees is lately known to have been engaged. Only possible
    explanation would appear to be that prior to his decease he had
    forwarded his manuscripts elsewhere, and that he was meditating
    composition of another when death overtook him. Medical evidence,
    however, places hour of decease about two a.m., and why the defunct
    man should remain at his desk far into the night without putting
    pen to paper is another point which remains shrouded in obscurity.

    "'No cause so far has been assigned for Mr. Mirlees' sudden end,
    and the strange and tragic affair will of course necessitate
    coroner's inquest. Mr. Mirlees was thought to be enjoying good
    health, though his manner had been observed to be moody and
    distraught for some time, as if he were prey to some severe mental
    stress; this, however, is alleged by those who knew deceased
    orientalist best to have been a not uncommon mood with him.'"

    "Mr. Ronald Mirlees was a widower, having lost his wife in Shanghai
    some years back, and so far as is known leaves no relatives to
    mourn his loss. His death will be keenly felt among scholarly
    circles of the Far East, however, and indeed of the East
    generally, to whose researches in oriental art and arch√¶ology he
    contributed matter of recognised value, though not a few of our
    prominent sinologues were disposed to regard Mr. Mirlees' essays
    as more brilliant and imaginative than sound. His best known and
    most characteristic work was the volume entitled _Treasure of
    Asia_, which appeared only last year, and as is no doubt still
    fresh in the minds of our readers aroused a storm of controversy
    not only on this side of the world, but also among the learned
    societies of Europe and America. At the risk of repeating facts
    already known we will here state that Mr. Mirlees' work embodies
    much original matter of deep interest concerning the Buddhist
    faith and Buddhist temples of China, dealing more particularly,
    as the title indicates, with instances of treasure buried in and
    around the ancient shrines. The deceased author's critics, and
    there were many, challenged his statements on grounds of fact,
    alleging that no authentic evidence of these supposed hoards
    exists, and especially on the score of propriety, as they feared
    that Mr. Mirlees' allegations would have the unfortunate effect of
    attracting to this country an undesirable class of treasure-hunters
    who would desecrate religious sites in the mere hope of gain. We
    are happy to record that this fear has not been realised. Such
    excavations as have been made have been carried out under the
    auspices of duly authorised oriental societies, and though the
    finds so far brought to light have not been extensive, they have
    afforded considerable proof of the shrewdness and accuracy of Mr.
    Mirlees' speculations. It is admitted at least that the deceased
    scholar had opened up a branch of study of peculiar fascination: a
    line of research which if not absolutely new, has so far never been
    sufficiently explored; and there seems reason to anticipate that
    later excavations will still further vindicate his arresting and
    outspoken views.

    "Mr. Mirlees had something of the scholarly recluse in his
    disposition, and was personally known to but few residents in this
    country; he was, nevertheless, well liked and admired by such as
    were privileged to enjoy his friendship, and his death while still
    in the prime of life--he was in his thirty-seventh year--will be
    universally deplored."

The foregoing item of news came to me with a peculiar poignancy and
shock. I was one of those few persons quoted in the report as having
enjoyed the privilege of Mirlees' friendship. I had not known him
intimately, it is true, or for any great stretch of time, but there are
circumstances which cement friendship more swiftly by far than mere
knowledge of a man's history and companionship with him in the common
workaday run of the world. If to have shared a strange and perilous
adventure and to have escaped with him a horrible death by violence
be title to friendship, I was indeed the friend of Ronald Mirlees.
The details of this affair I have recorded elsewhere, and need not
recount at any length here. It is enough to say that after making
Mirlees' acquaintance in the queerest and most unconventional manner
I accompanied him on an expedition to an ancient Buddhist temple
some forty miles out from the city of Peking, where, by deciphering
the inscription carved on the inner surface of the great temple bell,
Mirlees hoped to locate a rich hoard of buried gems, an offering
to the shrine by some pious donor of the remote past. How we were
received by the last surviving priest of the sect, how he most subtly
and devilishly plotted to murder us both, how he lost his own life in
the attempt and was even instrumental in directing us straight to the
cache, and how we took possession and escaped with our bare lives,
pursued by a band of the local peasantry out to kill--these matters, as
I say, have been chronicled in another place.

After that episode Mirlees returned to Shanghai, which he was wont to
make his headquarters, and I heard no more of him until the publication
of that remarkable book entitled _Treasure of Asia_ sent his name
whooping round the erudite world. Our North China adventure was not
specifically recorded in that work: I imagine that Mirlees judged the
affair too recent to be safely alluded to, fearing lest our ownership
of the treasure trove be disputed; but it unquestionably afforded to
himself, if he needed such, a crowning proof of the soundness of his
views, to say nothing of ample funds wherewith to meet the expense of
publication.

The report of the inquest came a few days after the news of Mirlees'
death. Nothing had been found to account satisfactorily for this,
and the medicos were obliged to wrap their ignorance in a few foggy
generalities regarding obscure affections of the heart. The finding
would have far from satisfied public opinion at Home. It left me
distinctly sceptical even in so raw and haphazard a region as the
Far East. There was something hidden, some mystery left unravelled.
Mirlees' age had been correctly stated in the newspaper report as only
thirty-six years; he was, moreover, of that "hard-bitten" type which,
if it dies young, does so only by a violent or unnatural death.

I was still pondering the melancholy problem a week later when I
received from a firm of solicitors in Shanghai a letter stating that in
pursuance of the request made to them some days before by their client,
the late Ronald Mirlees, they were forwarding to me, separately, a
parcel which he had left in their charge. The lawyers added that while
respecting the promise Mirlees had extracted from them not to reveal
this matter to any third party, they relied on my honour to make public
any evidence the parcel might contain which would help the authorities
to arrive at some conclusion regarding Mr. Mirlees' mysterious death.
Of the contents of the package they themselves were totally ignorant.

A day after that the parcel arrived. I tore off the outer covering and
found inside it a bundle wrapped in stout oilskin, sealed at every
point and so enmeshed in cords that I could scarcely read the legend
on the two labels. They were addressed to me in a curiously scrawled
writing, and when I had taken off this cover, there dropped out a
small fat envelope in the same hand, but more recognisable to my eye.
It was, so far as I could remember, the writing of Ronald Mirlees.

"Dear Hugh Jevons" (ran the missive)--

"It becomes necessary that you should step in to help me a second
time--and a last time--in my life. I have not forgotten how you helped
me before. You were a solid man to me then, and it is proof enough.
I believe you a solid man still that I have picked upon you to be
custodian of my confidences now that I can no longer hold them myself.
You will understand what I mean, as you read on.

"In the first place, my number is up. I see death approaching as
clearly as you look to the rise of to-morrow's sun. But I do not intend
that my secret shall die with me. Some other human being must carry
on the knowledge I have gained during the past year, for I feel there
is more in my experience than mere marvel and mystery and adventure.
I feel, I _know_, that there is a purpose at work behind it all: that
the Great Artificer who planted us, bickering insects, upon this planet
never willed that such truths as I have unearthed should sink back
into oblivion after a man of the real, outer world has penetrated to
them--and sacrificed his life in the doing. It wouldn't square with my
idea of the Great Artificer.

"Not for your scholarship or your knowledge of the East have I chosen
you to be legatee of my secrets--you would hardly flatter yourself that
far. I was under no illusion as to your qualifications for partnering
me before--but you partnered me handsomely, for all that. You were
ready to listen to my theories at a time when men with far bigger
pretensions pooh-poohed them; you were intelligent enough to let my
brains do duty for the pair of us. The orthodox oriental societies were
not always that intelligent. For them, those pretty stones we picked
out from under the ruin of Lao Tien Ssu would be there now, and the
book which is my chief claim to be remembered would languish still in
manuscript. I must have told you that was how I utilised the bulk of
my share in the loot? Anyway, it was. _You_ helped me to the ownerless
gems, comrade. _You_ had a hand in financing _Treasure of Asia_. _You_,
therefore, have assisted materially in throwing light on this dim-lit
quarter of the globe. I've known respected God-fearing professional
orientalists who couldn't say as much--without a lie.

"Now I claim a bigger service of you. I've instructed my lawyers to
send you this packet only after my death. It was a pretty blistering
oath I collected from the senior partner of the firm, and I think he'll
respect it. What I want done with the manuscript is another story.
I will be perfectly frank with you. I consider it to be a dangerous
thing--unless rightfully used. You wouldn't carry fulminate of mercury
about in your pocket, would you? Well, I regard this manuscript as more
deadly than fulminate of mercury. I solemnly assure you that I believe
death began to close in upon me from the moment I resolved to make
a record of the events with which this manuscript deals. It sounds
fantastic, does it not? Perhaps you will alter your opinion as you read
on.

"But, you may ask, since I am convinced I am to die in any event, why
do I not publish the manuscript now? I answer that it is in the nature
of an act of submission. I swore to keep these matters secret from the
world. In intention, I broke my oath. The punishment at once gathered
over my head. I acquiesce in the justice of it. It is the difference
between the criminal who confesses on the scaffold and the coward
who professes innocence to the end, between dying contrite and dying
in revolt. I have chosen the former course. It still sounds wild and
incredible? That view, too, I think you will come to abandon.

"But, you say again, was it a comradely act to pass the narrative on
to you? I reply, not uncomradely. The detonator is harmless enough in
a situation where it cannot be touched off. So with this manuscript.
I am convinced, nay, certain, that no danger threatens you so long as
you hold the secret close in your own bosom. It is no blind unreasoning
malignance we have to deal with, but a sentient power, and as I now
see, a just one, meting out punishment only where there is guilt. I
have been guilty: therefore I am doomed. You, so long as you keep the
secret, are guiltless: you will be unharmed. Why, then, have I not
destroyed the manuscript and with it the risk of betrayal? Because, as
I have written before, I do not believe it was intended that the secret
should perish utterly for the outer world. Perhaps, in years to come,
the powers which forbade me to reveal these matters will lift the veto.
Should that occur, have no doubt that they will find means to convey
their will to you, they, who have found no difficulty in making known
to me, over a distance of untold miles, that I must die.

"Till then, comrade, lock this secret in the innermost recesses of
your soul. Hold the manuscript safe. Leave nothing to chance. Deposit
it under seal with your bankers or your lawyers, with instructions
that nothing is to be done with it without your express command, and
that should you die without giving that command, the package is to be
destroyed unopened. For I say again that there is a doom in it, a doom
which I now see approach me as clearly as I see from the window of this
hotel the big, butt-ended freighters swinging on the tide of Whangpu
River.

"As to the manuscript, every word in it is as true as our finite human
brains can know aught to be true. Nothing is written but what I have
seen with my own eyes or heard with my own ears. The narrative will
amaze you, doubtless, but I give you credit for the intelligence not
to meet it with a stupid unreasoning denial. Let me appeal to you to
put aside all your preconceived notions as to what is and what is not
in this queer, half-known quarter of the earth. Above all, banish
from your mind the least shadow of suspicion that I am either mad or
insincere. I am as sane as you are, and in dead earnest. Consider
the probabilities. Is it for one instant to be supposed that I, who
see death hard upon me, should write a monstrous hoax?--that I, who
came East when I was little more than a boy and have given my whole
working life to the search for hard facts regarding the East, should
now fritter my last hours on mere romance of the imagination?--that I,
who have boldly stated the truth as I found it, even though this often
exposed me to hostility and derision from the orthodox, timid-minded
scholars of this land, should abandon truth for falsehood at a moment
when I am due to appear before a Higher Tribunal which knows nothing
but eternal truth?

"I take my leave of you with every warm wish for your happiness. I am,
I may say, without kin of my own, and at about the time this package
arrives you will receive from the same firm of lawyers a notification
that I have named you my heir to such small parcels of this world's
goods as I possess. The property consists almost wholly of personal
effects, trophies, curios--some of them valuable, by the way--and
the copyright of my published works. The more precious part of my
belongings goes with this letter. I offer it to you not as proof of
the truth of my narrative, but as a gift made in good fellowship to a
comrade who risked his life with me in a quest few men in the world
would have taken on. But there is a condition attaching to the legacy.
I charge you that if at any future date it becomes possible, in the
manner I have hinted, for you to publish this manuscript, you should
do so, using what may be necessary of the proceeds from sale of the
contents of the accompanying box. Even should you print the narrative
on gold leaf and bind it in choicest silk, there will still be left
money enough to maintain you in luxury to the end of your days.

"Good-bye.

"Ronald Mirlees, known as Ran Mirlees, Master of Arts in the University
of Edinburgh, Scotland, and now resident in the Marco Polo Hotel,
Shanghai, China, this first day of January in the year of Our Lord
19--."

Enclosed in the package was a heavy skin box, about eight inches square
by four high. I opened this with a small key hanging by silk thread
from the lid, and at once sat back in my chair gasping and blinking
with astonishment. The casket was full to the brim with large uncut
diamonds, not one of them smaller than a marble and all apparently of
very fine quality. My skill in gems was not professional, but I could
see at a glance that these stones must be worth many thousands of
pounds sterling; and if I had been curious to read Mirlees' manuscript
before, now my eagerness was whipped to the point of fever. I tore off
the wrappings from the close-writ ten quarto sheets and began to peruse
them.

The house boy came in with a note from Randegger (my partner at the
office) inquiring rather acidly if I was ill. I looked up at the
clock. It was two in the afternoon. I then remembered that the boy
had entered the room some time before but that I had ordered him out
without hearing what he had to say. That must have been at tiffin
time: I had been reading for four hours solid, lost to all else in the
world. I sent a note to Randegger pleading urgent private affairs,
and resumed the reading of Mirlees' narrative. It was dark before I
had finished, for the manuscript, though not of an inordinate length,
was written, till quite near the end, in Mirlees' crabbed, scholarly,
meticulously fashioned hand, and did not admit of a rapid perusal. Nor
was the subject matter of a sort to encourage skipping. As I worked
from phase to phase of the amazing story it seemed to me that never
before in the history of written words could so strange, so incredible,
yet withal so convincing a record of events have been placed on paper.
Time after time I flung down the manuscript almost in anger--only to
pick it up a moment later and find the precise spot where I had left
off. Now I felt that I was in the grip of a tale of such force as only
the hall-mark of truth can give, now I seemed to be listening to the
ingenious but wild fancies of a madman. Here was human experience set
at naught, the history which has passed as certainty for two thousand
years brusquely picked up and thrown down gutted like cod under the
fishmonger's knife--and on what evidence? The statements of one man,
unsupported by a single witness. It was monstrous, unthinkable! No sane
person could have offered such testimony. It is a commonplace saying
that genius may come near to insanity. Mirlees possessed the brilliant,
bold, penetrating type of intellect which we are in the habit of
calling genius--that I had felt during my previous encounter with him.
Surely towards these his last days his brain had given way, and this
screed I was now perusing was the reflection not of his observations
and experience but of the disordered fancies of an unbalanced mind?

I came to the end of the manuscript and laid it down with a great
wave of pity for the dead man. As I did so, once more there caught my
eye the box of uncut diamonds, their brilliancy darting irrepressibly
through the crust of impurities that overlaid them. At least the writer
had vouchsafed some solid support for his statements, though he had
appealed to me not to regard the gems as such, or even to require proof
beyond his own written words.

Of the circumstances under which this amazing record is now laid before
the world I have written later. Of the truth and sanity, or otherwise,
of Mirlees' assertions, it shall be left to the reader to judge.

Here, then, follows the narrative of Ronald Mirlees, exactly
transcribed from his own manuscript which I received from the dead
man's lawyers more than thirteen years ago.




                               CHAPTER I

                     THE AFFAIR OF THE OPIUM HELL


My name is Ronald Mirlees, or Ran Mirlees as I have usually signed
myself under those contributions to the learned press of the East by
which I have chiefly picked up a living, and through which I am known
to a good deal wider circle of readers than ever I possessed friends.
I was born thirty-six years ago, son of a schoolmaster, on the fringes
of Paisley, in Scotland. After completing my schooling in that town
and my course at the University of Edinburgh, where I took the degree
of Master of Arts, I came to the East, a region of the globe which had
deeply fascinated me from boyhood up.

Arrived here, I at once plunged into the study of eastern languages
and history and religion which I had begun at Home, earning my bread
the while by odd jobs of journalism--though not always the brand of
journalism I should have chosen if I hadn't been starving when I did
it. Those early days were about the most desperately thin period of
a life which has never run to fat. Later on my name got to be better
known, and my pen better paid, and I might in time have aspired to a
sedate competence if I had been able to purvey the kind of orientology
the public expects. Unfortunately, I wasn't. That sort of orientology
I found to be too full of elementary error, too much given to vague
and shallow report compiled in the study with the help of other men's
books, to commend itself to me. I soon saw that such things as native
life and the native point of view couldn't be soundly written about by
any man who had not gone _fantee_ himself, for the information gets
very distorted even when it comes through the medium of servants and
hired teachers and the tame type of native who prides himself on his
foreign friends. The art of living "native" was about the first I set
myself to learn when I came to the country, and ever afterwards, when
I wanted facts, I dived into the raw mass of yellow humanity to get
those facts direct, and I passed them on exactly as they had come to
me. It was good orientology, but bad policy for a penniless journalist
largely dependent on the favour of his fellow scholars to get work at
all. I became an "outsider," a blackleg, in more or less perpetual bad
odour. It was annoying, naturally, for the accepted authorities to
have certain of their pet mis-statements, which had been handed down
from generation to generation after being blindly cribbed in the first
place from the writings of some sinologue long dead, abruptly exploded
by that one real, first-hand, naked fact I had collected from the
folk of the Far East in person. The wider my knowledge and experience
grew, the more of these venerable bearded errors I found it necessary
to kill off, and my popularity in learned circles steadily dwindled.
The culminating point came when I published my best known and least
conciliatory work under the title of _Treasure of Asia_. Every scholar
in the land, and a host of people who couldn't by any stretch of the
word be called scholars, attacked this hapless book virulently, yet
even within the past year facts have come to light which go far to
confirm those I had written.

The book brought me fame, or at least notoriety, but little else.
Certainly not money. Indeed, to the best of my belief, I lost
substantially over it. I never could give business correspondence the
applied study it no doubt deserves, and I'm afraid my publisher's
letters remained for the most part on my mantelpiece, half skimmed
through, wholly undigested, eventually to become spills. I have an
uncertain recollection of his telling me once that to produce _Treasure
of Asia_ the way I wanted it produced would mean selling the book
at a loss. Perhaps that's what happened. I cared little, for at the
beginning of our dealings I was, strangely enough, well off, as the
result of a risky but highly profitable investigation I had carried out
some months before. The proceeds of that adventure took wings and flew.
Soon I found myself drifting again towards the impecuniousness that has
been my normal condition through life. Also, I was getting restless,
short of patience, dissatisfied with the one bed I was sleeping in
night after night. Arrangements to publish _Treasure of Asia_ had
confined me a good deal to the European quarter of Shanghai, a city
for which I never harboured any great love, and I felt once more the
stirrings that have so often driven me up country to the wild interior.
I wanted to see life raw and naked again, to wrestle another fall with
those yet unprobed mysteries of the East that have always held such a
profound, half-grim fascination for me. My wife had died several years
before, and with her passed out the one tie that could have reconciled
me to fixture in one humdrum existence; since her death, indeed,
I'd been a planet with a zigzag orbit, halted only by shortage of
funds--and not always that.

I come now to my last adventure, beside which whatever I had met before
in the way of queer experience--and my life has embraced some very
queer experience--seems tameness itself: an adventure surely stranger
and wilder than ever fell to the lot of another man living or dead.
Let me say at the starting out that this narrative which follows is
literally true from beginning to end. It may, if ever it sees the light
of day, be disbelieved; it may even be laughed down as the vapourings
of a lunatic. That will not detract one jot from its truth. If I have
dwelt at length on my previous record, it is only for the purpose of
making my real position clear, and letting any reader of this narrative
see that if I have been regarded in the past as no true authority on
oriental matters, that was not because of my failure to write facts
about the East, but of my resolute refusal to perpetuate accepted
errors. Let this suffice for the present. Later on the time must
come when wider knowledge and exacter exploration will vindicate my
assertions up to the hilt.

       *       *       *       *       *

It was a hot, moist, stifling evening of May. A dun haze lay heavy over
the river, where native junks and sampans and steam tugs were churning
the oily water into an evil-smelling froth the colour of coffee. Seldom
had the city of Shanghai so revolted me, and as I strolled along the
crowded Bund I reflected that I would give a king's ransom--if I
had it--to get out into open country or open sea and away from this
strident, feverish, dollar-grubbing prison on Whangpu River.

My footsteps led me to the side of Soochow Creek, across the bridge
and northward and eastward, beyond banks and wharves and godowns, into
a locality I remembered from having visited before, though I don't
suppose I could have mapped it with any pretension to accuracy. Nor
did I pay great heed to my direction, for I was weary, washed out
with boredom and the sickening, stewy heat, and walked slowly and
aimlessly. In time I found myself penetrating deeper and deeper into
a dense warren of native dives, cranky houses bulging out over the
grimy, narrow, snaking, flagged lanes and leaning one upon another
this way or that, like a row of soused revellers arm in arm. I must
have wandered some way through this maze, for it was now twilight, a
twilight still further deepened by the beetling houses and shop signs
in Chinese character which often hung so thick as to blot out entirely
the twisting riband of sky overhead. Then I came to that blind alley
which, though I little dreamed it then, was to prove the threshold of
the biggest and queerest adventure of my life.

Though hazy on a point of geography, I knew something of this
neighbourhood, with its opium-dens and gambling hells, and I
hesitated some minutes before advancing. That narrow cut seemed to
leave the wholesome world all behind it. There might be interesting
matters ahead, I felt, but there would very possibly be more danger
than interest, particularly for a man in European clothes. Almost
unthinkingly I ran my hand over the hip of my pongees. It seemed a
downright fatality. I wasn't in the habit of carrying firearms in a
city the size of Shanghai--unless I had some definite objective which
I knew to be risky. To-night I had nothing, yet some vague impulse or
other had caused me to slip a revolver into my pocket before coming out
from the hotel. That shooting-iron was at least as good an argument
as I could have on my side if I happened to get into an overheated
discussion, and it decided me to go forward.

The end of the alley was completely blocked by a double folding
door, with boss-shaped brass lock of native pattern. On this portal
I knocked. There was no reply. Then I tried the "opium-den" rat-tat,
a bit of special knowledge I had often found effective in the past.
Still the door remained close shut; but for certain muffled sounds of
revelry beyond it I should have concluded there was nobody to answer
my summons. At last, however, one half of the door came a few inches
ajar, and a puckered yellow face showed in the chink. Here, too,
there seemed an odd hint of the fatalistic. I'd never been to this
den before, yet I recognised the doorkeeper at once--perhaps from
some former visit to a dive of similar kind. The doorkeeper likewise
recognised me, and after some hesitation allowed me to enter.

There was a small porch behind the door, plunged in pitch dark, through
which we passed into the den itself. It was of the usual pattern
for places of the sort, but a good deal larger, and had also about
it palpable signs of foreign influence. The walls were lined with
squalid-looking couches, where natives in all degrees of robustness or
decrepitude reclined drowsily over their opium pipes, but the nave of
the dim-lit hall was dotted here and there with ramshackle tables and
chairs after the fashion of a European drinking hell, and at one end
was, apparently, a low stage, now screened off by a silk curtain across
which yellow dragons were chasing wisps of conventional whorled cloud.
Manifestly this half-breed den was wont to cater not so much for the
unsophisticated native as for the sea-going, semi-Europeanised type,
and for that queer underworld of foreigners of the beach-combing class.
Hence the dramatic stage and the grotesquely incongruous restaurant
tables, and the "fire-water" which I saw--and smelt even above the
sickly reek of opium--to be on sale in the place.

I sat down at one of the tables nearest the back of the hall, while a
boy brought me tea and melon-pips. He had proposed fire-water first,
but I thought not. The European who starts to swallow that unholy
preparation may as well throw in his hand. After a while an eerie
wailing of native violins rose from somewhere to one side of the stage,
and the curtain was drawn crosswise, revealing a girl posed for the
dance. She would have presented, to anybody enamoured of the type, an
attractively exotic figure, her long brown-black hair flowing loose,
her lithe limbs swaying to and fro with the evil grace of a snake,
her oblique almond-shaped eyes half closed, and small round breasts
heaving with an air of drugged passion. The dance was little more than
a succession of postures, involved, elaborate, voluptuous, sometimes
intentionally indelicate; and having watched many exhibitions of the
kind before, I was not a little weary of it by the end. This came in
the middle of an unusually plaintive scrape of the fiddles; the girl
broke off suddenly and sank to the stage in a tinkle of jewellery, amid
grunts of "_Hao! Hao!_" from all quarters. Then the company resumed
its pipes, and the grumble of talk that had slackened ever so slightly
during the dance grew loud again.

There were several other performances on the primitive stage, but
nothing that I could see of any novelty or interest, and I was sinking
steadily deeper into boredom. I'd already made up my mind to clear
out and look for adventure elsewhere, and was rising to do so, when
there came under my eye the first sight to hold it that evening. By
this time the room had filled up--though I could see no foreigner
besides myself--and taken on a brisker air. Some few of the smokers,
it is true, had dropped asleep and lay in queerly twisted attitudes
across the side-couches, but others had come instead to the stage of
exaltation. They sat up on the foot of the beds, drank from the chipped
water jug which a boy was carrying round, and breathed in deeply, with
that wild dilation of the eyes and glare of ecstasy of the opium fiend
which always, though I have seen it often enough to get hardened,
strikes me as such a loathsome distortion of the human countenance.

But it wasn't the opium smokers that had trapped my attention. What I
was looking at was a table a little way from mine, where two Chinese
sat in the most earnest conversation. You wouldn't have thought this
dive, given over as it was to amusement of a sort and debauchery of
a worse, was any manner of a place to do business in, but this pair
appeared to think so, for there they sat whispering and nodding and
wagging fingers at one another for all the world as if it were a
question of dethroning the Emperor. They were so placed that I had a
profile view of both faces, and even by the bad light of the place
I could see that one of these men was rather handsome, uncommonly
so for a Chinese, and handsome, too, with that queer approach to
the European type of beauty which will crop out now and again among
well-bred Chinks; whereas the other was of such a repellent ugliness
as not even I, in all my wanderings over the myriad-faced Land of Han,
had ever seen exceeded or even equalled. I watched this ill-assorted
couple slyly, and began to wonder what it could be that engaged them
in such a deedy talk. They spoke in very low whispers, with their
heads close together, and nobody in the room could have caught a word
of what they were saying; but for all that it came to me with a queer
sort of presentiment that there was foul play brewing. I scanned them
more closely. It appeared to me the good-looking Chink was pressing
some request upon the other, urging, arguing, now almost entreating;
but to every advance the ill-favoured fellow returned a stolid if not
absolutely ungracious refusal.

At this point the curtain drew back again from the stage and about half
a dozen girls, a good deal closer to a state of nature, as it seemed
to me, than their art really demanded, began a sort of choric dance
together. The measure started lazily enough, but quickened bit by bit
with the music, rising at last to such a pitch of frenzy that the whole
stage was one blurred whirl of flying beads and naked brown limbs. This
was clearly to be taken as the star show of the evening. Grunts of
approbation came louder and more frequent on all sides. Even the couple
I was watching looked up from their chin-wagging and stared at the odd,
wild spectacle on the stage. At last, with a concerted leap high into
the air, the dancers came to a halt and flung themselves down on to the
boards in a sort of tableau, a dusky picture of unholy seductiveness;
then the curtain was drawn amid loud barks of applause.

The drawing of the curtain threw everything into gloom until lamps
were brought in from somewhere behind the hall. It was in this short
interval of twilight that the ugly Chink made a sudden slight gesture,
as if to somebody at the far side of the room. So unobtrusive was the
movement that had I not been on the alert I should certainly not have
noticed it at all. As it was, the handsome fellow looked to be totally
unaware of anything wrong, for he plunged again into talk as earnest
as ever, while his companion answered him with an air of unshaken
determination. Then I realised the game. A third figure was edging
nearer and nearer the two, and I saw that this man was carrying, half
hidden in his ample sleeve, a stout, heavy bottle. The ugly Chink,
clearly, was talking to hold the attention of the handsome one while
the accomplice approached him from behind--with intent there was no
mistaking.

I called sharply to the prospective quarry, but too late. At this
very instant the lamps were obscured for another act on the stage.
The man with the bottle glided forward and aimed a savage blow at the
good-looking Chink. It fell on the back of his black skull-cap, with a
horrible hollow crack, and the man went down like a log. In a flash the
other had pounced upon him, tearing at his long robe as if to get at
something in the inner folds.

Now I knew well enough that in places of this kind, which are none
too wholesome for a European at the best, it would be sheer lunacy
to interfere in any and every quarrel that might break out between
natives. The only thing to do then is to get into the street, on your
belly if there's shooting or knife-throwing, in any case the quicker
the better. But there was a cold brutality and treachery about this
assault that set my blood boiling and stirred every ounce of the sense
of fair play that was in me. Moreover, I had taken a queer sort of
fancy to the handsome Chinaman. Perhaps it was because he left his
enemies so far behind in the way of looks, but I think also I was
attracted by the air of decency and straightforwardness which he had
and the others certainly had not. Anyway, I had thrown prudence to the
winds in an instant, and taken shares in the row to the full amount of
my capital. I sprang on to the ugly Chink and flung him off his victim,
then picked up the stunned man and backed towards the door with him in
my arms; but the tables and the thick crowd were all against escape
that way. Besides, the bottle man had edged round behind me, and there
I stood, carrying a helpless stranger, midway between two of the ripest
looking scoundrels in Asia. I saw that my one chance would be to get my
back to the wall and hold on until I could attract help, if any, from
outside. It was a slender hope, but the best that occurred to me at the
moment.

I rushed my burden to one of the side-couches and dropped him on to
a sleeping opium smoker, who rolled to the floor with a curse. The
next instant I was yelling at the top of my lungs, and the two Chinks
were making at me from different directions. Luckily, my father had
taught me as a boy the sovereign virtue of a straight left--a bit of
education that has stood me in better stead than all he ever imparted
out of his primers. I hit out, caught the nearest of my attackers on
the point of his weedy chin, and sent him spinning back amongst the
crowd. The other came on, and received a like dissuader from my right.
Neither blow was a true king hit, however, and neither Chink was
anything near knocked out: on the contrary, the setback only seemed
to have whipped up all the venom in the pair of them, and there they
crouched, spitting curses, amongst which I caught the repeated epithet
of "foreign devil." This was disquieting. So far, the sense of the
room seemed to be a sort of armed neutrality, but I knew that if this
villainous partnership succeeded in inflaming popular feeling on the
score of race, I shouldn't last the minute out. I yelled again for the
police, all I knew how.

The bottle man had dropped the bottle, and I caught the glint of a
knife in his hand. I snatched out my revolver. I had intended to use
this only in the last resort, but there was nothing else for it now.
The fellow sprang at me with a hiss, and I distinctly remember how my
slow, erring senses coupled that sound with the flash of the knife as
it swept up in a half-circle. I aimed as low as possible, but there
is no guaranteeing results in an affair like that. I am much afraid
the bullet took my gentleman in the entrails and put a period to his
crimes there and then. He had his revenge, however. With the firing of
that shot the sympathies of the room turned very definitely against
me. There was an ugly movement in the crowd. I swept the front rank
with my gun, and they drew back a little--only a little, but long
enough to allow me to dash forward and snatch the knife out of the dead
man's hand and get back to the couch by the wall. The crowd resented
this move. A howl of rage went up. Those in a position to know say the
howling of an angry Chinese mob is the most terrible sound in this
world, and I agree. The end couldn't be long coming. One rush, and I
must be overwhelmed and meet such a handling as the mind would not
picture. On they came. I fired into the brown--two, three, four, five,
six--and at the last report felt a sudden sharp sting in my wrist and
heard the empty revolver clatter to the floor. Somebody had thrown a
knife.

At this moment, when frankly my chances didn't look worth the hole in
a copper cash, help came from a quarter the very least expected. The
good-looking Chink sat up, as if roused to life by the repeated shots.
He stared about him for the bare fraction of a second, then leapt to
his feet. And now followed the most astonishing phase of the whole
fight. Darting to the nearest of the fallen, my new ally gripped him by
the ankles, and with a miracle of strength I should never have dreamed
possible in a man, jerked the limp body above his head and swung it
round and round. Twice this terrible human club fell, and twice a
swathe of men went down beneath it.

'This way,' he muttered to me in the vernacular, dashing out into the
room. The mob drew back, more from amazement than fear, leaving an
irregular path between the tumbled chairs and tables. I followed close
on my ally's heels. Now we had gained a small door on the far side, to
which he nodded. As I flung it open and dashed through I caught over my
shoulder a glimpse of the human mace swinging aloft again. My companion
had wheeled around, hurled the body at the nearest of the crowd who
were already closing in behind us, and followed me through the open
door, securing it after him.

Together we ran along a short dark corridor, thence out into the open
air. The lane in which we found ourselves was surprisingly broad, and
at the end of it, to my even greater astonishment, stood a petrol car,
a small vehicle, but as it looked to me in the half-lit street, richly
finished and built with an eye to speed. The engine throbbed into life
at the first swing of the crank, and an instant later we had sprung up
and were moving away from the scene of the fight. Our escape, from the
moment when my ally recovered consciousness to the time we boarded the
automobile, cannot have taken more than half a minute; and as I look
back upon it, even after this lapse of months, the whole business seems
like a swift, vivid dream.

For a while the warren-like ways of this unsavoury district were
against us, and I could see, over the folded hood of the car, a dim
swirling mob of pursuers and hear their howling with still that
high-pitched, unmistakable note of murder in it. Our position was
improved, but still nasty in the extreme. Even if we got away from
the mob, we should certainly be arrested by the police if caught, in
which event there would be several woundings and at least one death to
explain, and that, too, against a swarm of witnesses who would swear
our lives away without a tinge of compunction.

Luckily, the streets quickly widened, and my companion was a driver
of a thousand. Scores of foot-passengers and pole-bearing coolies and
native barrows he missed by a bare hair's breadth; several corners in
succession he took on two wheels, but never for an instant slackened
the pace; and within five minutes the last uneasy sounds of pursuit
had died away. Still we continued to press on. The pair of us seemed
to realise by silent agreement that it would be a good thing for us to
vanish at once into some burrow where we could take counsel together on
the best way to elude the allied hostility of Law and Disorder.

The Chinaman drove westward for some distance, into that part of the
city where I had crossed the Soochow Creek several hours before. Then
we turned south, and in a few moments were spinning down the broad,
bright-lit Nanking Road, with its queer blend of western paving with
eastern shops and their garishly carved and gilded fronts. Some way
farther on we turned east once more into the fringes of the French
Concession, and at last drew up at a compact bungalow standing in its
own grounds at the point where town and country meet.

We seemed to have been expected, for no sooner had the noise of our
horn broken on the quiet night than I saw a wide wooden gate swing
open, and my companion had driven the car straight into its garage.
The gate was immediately closed. Nobody watching in the street a moment
later would have had a notion of our arrival. There was no light
whatever to be seen in the house.

The Chinaman jumped down, leading the way along a path hidden in
shrubbery, into a side door of the bungalow. This opened on a long dark
passage. My companion disappeared down this, leaving me in charge of
the native servant who had opened the gate to us. Together we entered a
small room richly furnished in Chinese style, with one or two fine old
scroll-pictures hung round the walls, and cabinets through the glass
doors of which I could see a collection of carvings in choice white
jade, and on top of the cabinets several vases of Ming porcelain.

The boy left me for a moment, returning with hot water and lint and
bandages for my wounded wrist, which I had roughly bound with a
handkerchief. He made a swift workmanlike job of the stab--fortunately
it had touched no big blood--and withdrew, leaving me sitting in a wide
silk-cushioned settee of blackwood and wondering what breed of Chinaman
it could be that drove a car like Gordon Bennett and swung full-grown
bodies about his head like Eric Brighteyes.

The room, heavily shuttered, was lit by a hanging lamp of brass, worked
into the form of a dragon, which didn't give a very brilliant light,
but quite enough to show me my companion clearly when he returned a few
minutes later. I had gasped with astonishment earlier in the evening,
when I saw him do the Brighteyes act. Now I gasped again. He was the
same person, exactly, in externals, even to the sleek celestial grin on
his yellow face, and yet there was a palpable change in the whole air
of the man. I couldn't lay my finger on the difference, but it was the
difference between chalk and cheese. Then even the grin fell away from
him, and he smiled, a frank, open smile.

'Well, Mr. Ronald Mirlees!' he said.

The words had been spoken in the perfect English of a well-bred man.




                              CHAPTER II

                                FLIGHT


I could do nothing but sit back in my seat and gape stupidly, while he
continued to look at me with an air of quiet, friendly amusement.

'Well, Mr. Ronald Mirlees,' he repeated, 'we had a close call to-night.
But for the extremely sandy way you joined in on my side it would have
been closer. Come, let me thank you for saving my life.'

I got a sufficient hold on my wits to rise and take the hand he held
out to me.

'I think it's I that have to thank you,' I said. 'I'm no invalid, but
I don't reckon to be able to sling full-grown men about my head like
Indian clubs. As to coming in on your side, it was more than any decent
human being could have done to sit tight and watch those blackguards
rob you.'

'Had they done so,' he said, gravely, 'it would have interfered with my
plans seriously--vitally, Mirlees!'

'But how do you come to know my name?'

'Dear me,' he replied, with a wonderfully winning laugh, 'if such a
well-known orientalist as yourself wants to visit that sort of den
_incognito_, he must assume a character--like this.' He took the long
Chinese robe between his thumb and forefinger and gave it a shake. 'But
one moment,' he continued, stepping to the side of the room and drawing
a card from a case. 'That's me.'

I took the pasteboard slip from his carefully browned hands and read:

                        MR. SAUNDERS PHILIPSON.

There was nothing else, not even the Chinese equivalent of our foreign
names which we usually print for the benefit of servants and native
tradesmen who cannot read English.

'Now,' said Philipson, waving me back to my settee and taking a
chair himself. 'We are in an uncommonly nasty hole. That much is
self-evident. Two or three of the men I saw on the floor of that den
to-night looked as if they were never going to get up again, and the
fellow I was obliged to use as a weapon of defence was certain stone
dead before I touched him. A melancholy business, no doubt, but I would
sooner they than we.'

'I emptied every chamber of my gun,' I said. 'And it was too near to
miss. I don't know how many deaths there are among that crowd, but
there are six wounds.'

'Quite so. That means a most awkward investigation. Unless we take
steps we may both find ourselves in queer street. You see the force of
my reasoning?'

'Doesn't require much seeing. What do you suggest?'

'We must avoid appearing at that investigation.'

'Lie low, you mean, till it blows over. If you can put me up here for a
day or two--'

'Utterly hopeless,' said Philipson. 'There were men there who know me
well. The car must have been recognised. You too, I believe, left a
revolver behind. It will be simplicity itself to trace the pair of us.'

'Then let's go to the police and make a clean breast of it. After all,
you were the first attacked.'

'I was; but the evidence will lie heavily the other way. Those people
have their story composed and rehearsed by now, backed by a dozen
provably independent witnesses. Depend upon it. They will swear we
provoked a quarrel, and we ourselves must admit that we did the
killing, without a casualty on our side. It would look black against us
even in a consular court.'

I had to admit that the pronounced likelihood of this notion had
already struck me.

'Moreover,' he continued, eyeing me closely, 'I have the very strongest
reasons for not wishing my dealings with that gang to come out.'

'What are we to do, then?'

'Cut. We must be out of this house and away inside ten minutes,' said
Saunders Philipson with decision.

'H'm. If they can set the police after us they can have the stations
watched.'

'No need to depart by rail. Fortunately there is the river. We are
near it here. I have my own launch moored off the French Bund. In half
an hour I will undertake to get you well on your way to Wusung, and
after that, barring typhoons, we can please ourselves, up coast or
down.'

I shall have to say it before long, and I may as well say here that
there was something about this man entirely new to my experience. I had
been strangely attracted towards him even through a marvellously clever
Chinese disguise, and the feeling was intensified tenfold now that I
saw him as he really was. Before the week was out I had realised that
he was long and away the most remarkable man I had ever met, and as
this narrative develops it will be seen I wasn't alone in my opinion.
There was something about Saunders Philipson that came along like a
great burning enthusiasm and swept up your loyalty and your love,
something that literally compelled trust. It was his way, when his
friends were wavering and he wanted to tune up their resolve, to talk
to them; let him talk to you for five minutes and your brain began to
reject the possibility that he could fail.

I must have looked still undecided now, for he leaned over the
blackwood table between us and spoke, and as he spoke, my doubts melted
away like mist under the morning sun.

'Trust me, Mirlees,' he concluded, the words coming out in a crescendo
of intensity. 'Trust me, and by God, you shall never have reason to
regret it.'

'Very well,' I said. 'It's putting ourselves in the wrong, but I'm game
if you are.'

Philipson took my hand again and wrung it. 'We are going to be friends,
I can feel,' he said. 'Now, we shall look less suspicious if we are
both in the same costume, and though few would believe it, I can turn
you into a Chinaman quicker than I can get myself back into a European.
Come into this room.'

I followed him along the passage to a little chamber curiously like the
dressing room of a theatre, and there, with the help of Philipson and
his boy and a pile of native clothes and dyes and artificial pigtails,
I was soon as presentable a Celestial as it is possible for a European
to make himself. Philipson chuckled as he watched me hurry into the
Chinese dress.

'Not your first appearance in this r√¥le, Mirlees?' he said.

'Not by miles,' I replied, frogging up the grey _maokua_ at my left
shoulder. 'Fan, pipe--I think that's everything.'

In a few moments Philipson had put back the native touches on his own
exterior, two ricshas appeared at the door as if from nowhere, and we
were whirling off towards the French Bund. Nobody made any attempt
to molest us, but I had an uncomfortable sense--perhaps a fanciful
one--that our movements were being noted; at any rate, when we came to
the water's edge it was clear enough this was the case. There were two
natives lounging on the wharf. They gave no sign that they had even
seen us arrive, but for all that I noticed, when I looked back from the
sampan in which we were pulling out to the mooring place of the launch
that both these loafers had disappeared.

I heard Philipson laugh softly to himself. 'You saw that, Mirlees?' he
said. 'Those fellows have gone back to report.'

'But _they_ couldn't know anything about the dust-up of to-night?'

'Not yet, perhaps, but they very soon will. And our friends of the
opium-den will know that we have left by the launch, which those two
had been detailed to watch.'

'Perhaps I could help better, Philipson,' I said 'if I knew exactly
what we _are_ up against.'

'An organisation, Mirlees,' he replied. 'A large and powerful and
highly unscrupulous one, too I fear. But the story is a long one, and
unless I am much mistaken our time for the next hour or so is going to
be fully occupied with more pressing matters.'

On board the launch, a long clean-lined craft and, as I knew before
I'd been two minutes in her of great engine power, we found a native
on guard. The fellow challenged us sharply as our sampan drew near.
Philipson's answer was to order him to start up and cast off moorings;
we boarded the launch, paid the sampan man, and a moment later had
swung away down stream without lights. The engine purred gently and
musically, but a big arrowhead of foam that lay out at once from our
bow proved we were moving fast, if quietly.

'Luckily,' remarked Philipson, 'I had anticipated some such little
upset as this. The launch has been held ready day and night for the
past week, and I have no doubt Ah Sing at least is glad matters have
come to a head. Eh, Ah Sing?'

The native engineer looked back from his specklessly tended charge, and
we heard him take a long inbreath of gratification.

'Engine b'long all-same numbah-one plopah,' he said. 'Plenty
sparkum-juice hab got. Can go Canton if'm likee.'

'Perhaps so,' said Philipson, 'but I do not think we will, although it
is pleasant to reflect that we could if we chose.'

'It must be pretty pleasant altogether to own a plaything like this,' I
said, running an admiring eye along her beautifully stream-lined hull.

'No doubt,' assented Philipson. 'But the worst of a modern invention is
that unless you corner it, anybody else can use it too. That applies to
other things besides motor boats, such as----'

Philipson had taken the tiller and was steering with a coolness and
dash that reminded me forcibly of his driving. Also he seemed to be
gifted with the eyes of a cat. We shot in amongst barges, sampans,
junks, tugs, steamers--all the medley of eastern and western craft that
crowd the winding Whangpu River--some of them lighted, others a mere
blotch of deeper black against the dark stream; some of which we missed
by inches, others literally scraped with our streaks. As we rounded the
curve and headed eastward I noticed that Philipson had his eyes fixed
on the north bank in a long tense stare.

'Telephones,' he said, shortly.

'Eh? Oh, you mean----'

'That the gentlemen who were watching this launch have probably
telephoned to the headquarters of the gang, which are, I believe, not
far from that den where we had such an unpleasant experience to-night.
It is admirably up-to-date of such people to adopt western devices,
but it may prove awkward enough to us. Now it only remains to be seen
whether they have got the information through quick enough to be of
use.... H'm, I feared as much. You see what I mean, Mirlees, when I
say that launches are a game two sides can play at. They must have had
theirs waiting too.'

We had come to a pool where the stream broadens greatly and is deep
enough to float ocean-going ships close in shore. We saw several fast
at their wharves on the south side. The north bank was crusted thick
with native shipping, and between shore lights and lights afloat the
river here was thrown into a wan, treacherous illumination. I had
followed Philipson's stare with my eyes: now I saw what he was looking
at. Something swift and black had detached itself from the mass and was
shooting out across our course.

'Ah Sing--engine,' said Philipson quietly. 'Mirlees, take the tiller.
Bring us as near them as you dare, but for God's sake do not give us a
leak, or we are done. Here is a revolver. Remember, though, we must not
risk the noise of shots unless hard pressed.'

I did as I was bid, while Philipson himself took the boathook and
crawled forward, where he crouched low on our decked-in bow. Soon I
saw the wisdom of his plan. It was typical of the man. His mind always
seemed to be made up the instant a fresh problem presented itself, and
his policy was usually a sudden original move, bold to the point of
impudence. On this occasion it met with brilliant success. There were
at least five men on the other launch, against our three, and had we
merely tried to dodge them, it's likely we should have been grappled,
boarded, and overpowered, or at least forced to use firearms and thus
bring out the river police. As it was, the very unexpectedness of our
attack threw the enemy into confusion and enabled us to get clean away,
so that watchers on shore could hardly have been aware of the little
drama that was being played in midstream. What actually happened is
this.

I ran our boat straight at the other, then at the last moment put the
helm hard down. A figure had sprung up in the bows of the enemy craft,
clearly intending to leap aboard of us, but he had reckoned without
Philipson and his boathook. Philipson also sprang to his feet, caught
the opposing bow-man full in the stomach, and hurled him backwards
into the river. There were the odds evened by one at the very outset.
The boats came together with a loud scraping clatter, and I saw two
natives seize our gunwale while a third, erect behind them, drew back
for a leap. Ah Sing pluckily gripped one man by the throat and dragged
him on to our boat, where the pair tumbled into the well and rolled
over and over, fighting like terriers. I was holding revolver and
tiller in my right hand. With my left I struck out, caught the second
gunwale man between the eyes and had the satisfaction of seeing him
stagger back, half overturning the man behind him. The check was only
momentary, however, for the fellow was up and inboard of us before I
could strike again. I saw a short club raised above my head, and threw
up my left arm in defence, but I never felt the blow fall. The man was
suddenly snatched away from in front of me. Philipson, having finished
his business in the bows, had rushed aft and seized my attacker by
the waist and lifted him off his feet as if he had been a child. Then
for the second time that evening I witnessed an exhibition of this
man's superhuman strength. He gave the body a sudden swing and hurled
it back on to the other boat with such terrific force that the fellow
overshot the mark altogether, sweeping one of his comrades overboard
with him. Next, pretty much as if he had been playing skittles, Mr.
Saunders Philipson stooped into the well, where Ah Sing had finally
got a strangle hold on _his_ antagonist, detached the two men, picked
our enemy up and threw him far out into the stream, where his sudden
yell was cut short in a great splash. The whole thing was over in a few
seconds, most of the enemy in the water, and the one native left aboard
of their boat unable to do more than throttle his engine and back and
circle to pick up the men overboard. We had broken away, and shot down
stream with a good start. Our leader put back the boat hook in the
rack under our gunwale and briefly inquired if anybody was hurt.

Ah Sing rubbed his ear with a hand that came away blood-stained from it.

'Dat piecee men,' he observed judicially, 'plenty stlong toosum-box hab
got. Him muchee bitum!'

'I will dress that for you in a minute, Ah Sing,' said Philipson
gravely. 'Give me the tiller, Mirlees. We are by no means out of the
wood. Those fellows may go ashore and telephone Wusung to have a police
boat waiting for us. Or they may--yes, by Jove, they are!'

I peered out astern, straining my ears. It was true. The other launch
was coming swiftly down stream in our wake.

'You think they can catch us?' I said.

'You saw for yourself the speed of that boat when she came out from the
bank. I know her of old. The one thing on the river that can beat her
is our own, and that not by a great deal. With the twist of the river I
question if we shall have the advantage at all.'

He dived forward through the cabin and returned with a stout square
board, which, with the help of Ah Sing, he wedged firmly athwart-ship
behind our engine.

'Bullets,' he explained. 'It may take the sting off them, at least, and
save us from getting winged. They will not dare to fire on this part
of the river, for fear of bringing the police about their ears--it is
obvious they do not want that any more than we do. But when we come to
the empty reaches lower down they may not be so squeamish. You know
the river, Mirlees?'

'Pretty fair.'

'Right. It is half ebb now. We draw barely two feet. Do not be afraid
to go inside the beacons if there is a good cut-off to be effected. I
had better dress Ah Sing's ear while I have the chance. Come along, my
faithful fellow.'

I sat well down to the steering that boat out of Whangpu River. It was
the reverse of a pleasure. We were soon come to the deserted reaches
Philipson had spoken about, and I wondered how long it would be before
the boat behind began to shoot. I could hear the hum of their engine
above ours--they were clearly gaining on us. The frequent bends were
robbing us of our advantage of superior speed, and steer straight as I
might I couldn't prevent it. Many times have I cursed the snakiness of
Whangpu River when crawling up it in steamers and impatient to be at
the end of a voyage, but never had I cursed it as I did that night.

Philipson's head appeared through the low doorway as he crept aft. At
the same instant a sharp crack rang out behind, and a long white streak
flashed on to the inside of our gunwale. Philipson bobbed back: for one
fearful moment I thought he was hit. But it wasn't that. He reappeared
with a Winchester rifle.

'This must be kept down, Mirlees,' he said, 'or at least replied to.
Crouch when I fire--the flash will give them a good aiming point.'

He laid the barrel across our gunwale, which, so smoothly were the
engines running made a fair rest, and fired. There was no result beyond
that two shots came from the other boat and we heard a bullet sing over
our heads.

'They too, it seems,' said Mr. Saunders Philipson deliberatively, 'have
fallen into the error of aiming high. Now the great thing in life,' he
observed as he reloaded, 'is to ... be wise ... from our failures ...
so!'

As a vindication of Philipson's philosophy it was immense, though I
was a good deal too scared to appreciate philosophy at the time. It
isn't pleasant to be pot-shotted, even in the vague light of night,
particularly when, apart from the risk to our own skins, one unlucky
bullet might have ruined our engine or our hull and left us at the
mercy of a shipload of bloodthirsty pirates. There was a shriek of pain
from behind us, followed by furious yells, and the firing held off.

'That has balanced the account for the time being,' said Philipson,
resuming the tiller himself. 'But I have a horror of bloodshed. If I
can possibly get away without firing another shot you may trust me to
do so.'

He was equal to his word. He handled that superb boat in a way that
made my best efforts look childish, and though after a while our
pursuers loosed off at us again, we were drawing too far ahead for the
gunning to be deadly. The stream continues to wind until it meets the
sea, but under Philipson's hand our course couldn't have been far short
of a straight line; curve after curve he sheared away with consummate
skill, as if he could not only see in the dark but sense the depth of
water under us; and though once we did plough mud with our keel, the
check was no more than momentary, and we had forged over into deep
water again. Once, too, we burst clean through a string of lighters
dropping down on the tide blind as ourselves, and I heard their towrope
rattle sharply along the roof of our cabin as we shot under it.

At last we came abreast of the junk fleet you can generally count on
finding anchored at the mouth of the river. Beyond that, open sea
and safety. Thanks to Philipson's brilliant boatcraft we had drawn
so far ahead of the other launch that the noise of her engine was
indistinguishable from ours, and I should have reckoned that with one
good spurt we might now show our enemies a clean pair of heels. Much to
my surprise, Philipson ordered Ah Sing to throttle down to half speed.

'It is risky, admittedly,' he said, 'but it will be safer in the long
run.'

A hoarse shout of triumph announced that the other launch had sighted
us. They came on cock-a-hoop, gaining fast and firing as they came.
Philipson now opened our throttle bit by bit, and we drew away, heading
south-east. In five minutes our speed was at full again, in fifteen the
sounds of pursuit were dying in the distance, until we could hear them
no longer. My companion now took a sharp turn, doubling back north-east
for a minute or two, then shut off our engine altogether; and there we
lay, rising and falling gently on the dark swell of the outer sea.

'You know where we are, Mirlees?' said Philipson suddenly.

'I should say off the south point of the old Quarantine Island,' I
replied.

'Exactly. And where do you suppose the other boat is?'

'God knows. But what are we hanging about here for?'

'In order to give our pursuers a good lead on their totally false
scent. As soon as they are well past we will get along. What were they
to suppose when I allowed them to view us making for the south end of
the island? Obviously that we intended to go down coast--Ningpo, I
fancy, is the port that will occur to them, as there is no likelihood
of weather. They will pursue for some way on the chance of our petrol
giving out. Then, when they find they do not pick up the sound of us
again, they will assume we are clear away south. They will return at
once to headquarters and warn Ningpo by telegraph--they have agents
there, never fear. Meanwhile, it behoves us to select some other
destination.'

'Where d'you propose?'

'What do you say to Nanking?'

'That must be a day's run, even at the best pace we can screw out of
her.'

'Why not? We have the fuel, and you may depend I have not been so
careless as to come away without food. Also, the farther afield
we go, the less likely are we to be available for the inevitable
inquiry into that awkward affair of to-night. Nanking appeals to me
as the ideal place for our purpose. It is a huge straggling city with
miles of country within its walls. It offers every facility for a
sudden departure by rail or water, should we have warning of pursuit.
The police will hardly look for us there, since the only people in
a position to give information regarding our movements will be of
opinion--for the time at least--that we are down coast. You, should you
find that the shooting affray has blown over, may return to Shanghai by
train at any time you like. I would advise you not to be in a hurry,
though. I am afraid, Mirlees, that by your magnanimous rescue of me
to-night you have made yourself obnoxious to some of the most dangerous
people in Asia. Were you to return to Shanghai now, I frankly could not
promise you a peaceful life--or for that matter life at all.'

It wasn't a particularly comforting argument, but it struck me as being
sound. 'Nanking be it then,' I said. 'We'll see to the future later.'

'And a wise decision, in my view,' said Philipson cheerfully, opening
the throttle and turning the boat's head north.

We skirted the Quarantine Island on its seaward shore, then headed
west for the estuary of Yangtze River. Philipson steered by the stars
and checked his course roughly by a pocket compass, but he would have
needed to be a pretty lubberly navigator to miss that enormous mark.
Suddenly he looked up.

'Forgive me, Mirlees,' he said. 'The rush of events has caused me to
forget my duties as host. Just go into the cabin and help yourself to a
meal. Ah Sing will give you everything you want.'

Now ravenously hungry, I didn't wait for a second invitation. The cabin
of the launch I found to be a surprisingly roomy apartment, with a
handy collapsible table amidships and broad lockers lining the sides.
Ah Sing was evidently schooled to do more than run engines, for he had
put up a capital collation of fresh cold meats and salad and white
wine, laid out amongst spotless napery and dainty table furniture.
In the roof of the cabin there was an electric globe which Ah Sing
switched on after carefully shutting the after door, and I noticed
mattresses and sheets and pillows rolled up on the ends of the lockers
against bed-time. Altogether, this launch would have been a cosy home
for a holiday, let alone a craft to run for your life in. I fell to,
ate like a savage, then put on a pipe and went aft to relieve Philipson
at the tiller.

All night we sped up into that greatest of China's waterways, the three
of us standing successive tricks of two hours each, and by daybreak
we had pierced the estuary to a point where the shores-a green-brown
line low down on either bow--began to be visible again. Mile after
mile we flung behind us; more and more we seemed to be in a river
rather than a sea. As the vast estuary narrowed, so all the divergent
tracks of up-river traffic drew in together; now we passed within
hail of an occasional steamer, and before long saw away to starboard
the eternal procession of junks as they hugged the north shore to
avoid the down-rolling volume of the stream. Philipson's knowledge of
the river seemed to be exact to the last detail; many of the shore
villages he named as we swept past were quite unknown to me, though I
recognised the Treaty Port of Chinkiang on our starboard bow early in
the afternoon, and wanted no telling when, at the fall of dusk, we drew
near the end of our long stage.

Well throttled down, we crept past Nanking Bund, giving it a wide
berth, then headed straight in for a creek Philipson had chosen as
being secluded enough for our business. Here we halted in midstream
while the pair of us changed into European clothes, and gently paddled
the launch inshore. You couldn't have hit on a better place for a
furtive landing. There was a queer old inn, big, rambling, well tucked
away, with its garden running down to the willow-shrouded bank, and
water enough in the creek to allow of our putting the launch right in,
so that we could step from the cambered roof of her cabin on to the
grey lichened garden wall. We gave out to the native proprietress that
we were merchants down stream from Hankow on a vacation, and engaged a
bedroom each--Ah Sing would sleep on board--and a sitting room in the
wing of the building overlooking the water; and there, after we had
fed, Philipson pushed a box of cigarettes towards me and sat back in
his chair with a strangely serious air.

'I owe you an apology, Mirlees,' he began.

'What on earth for?'

'I am afraid I have misled you.'

He sprang up, glided to the door as noiselessly as a cat, and flung it
open. I had heard nothing myself, but I now caught a glimpse of the
lady of the house withdrawing, feather dust-whisk in hand, to the far
end of the landing.

'Note one,' muttered Philipson, closing the door and resuming his seat.
'That woman needs watching. But, as I was saying, I fear I have not
been altogether frank. I led you to suppose that I was coming here
to escape the consequences of our little brawl last night. That was
only partly true. This Nanking journey is only the first stage of a
much longer one I am making--so long that the distance would probably
surprise you.'

'H'm. _How_ long?'

'Only time can measure the exact length,' said Saunders Philipson, 'but
I should estimate it at nearer three thousand miles than two.'




                              CHAPTER III

                         ENTER STEPHEN POYNING


The match I had struck to light my cigarette remained burning in my
fingers till it scorched them. I was waiting for Philipson to amplify
that last disclosure, but he appeared to be thinking of something else;
he had thrown back his head and was listening intently.

'Not a word now,' he whispered.

There was a knock on the door, and the innkeeper entered, laid four
bottles and two glasses on the table between us, and withdrew with that
queer bent-kneed bounce which natives use for a bow.

'Fortunately,' said Philipson, 'this inn has been patronised by
foreigners in the past, for whom the woman keeps a cellar. When we
arrived it was almost my first concern to explore it and take stock.
This is not a vintage claret, I am afraid, but it was the best quality
I could find.'

'You've made up for it in quantity, anyway,' I put in.

Philipson smiled. 'Have no fear,' he said. 'I fully understand that
the burden of consumption will rest upon me. It is, I may say, a
habit of mine to drink freely, and that of the best obtainable, on
all occasions. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than to drink large
quantities of good wine.'

I thought this was a pretty naive assertion for a man to make, but
Philipson seemed quite unconscious of anything queer about the
remark he had made. He poured out two glasses, pledged me politely,
and continued to sip with zest all the time he was talking. I fully
expected to see him get soused, but, far from that, beyond causing
him to speak with a little deeper earnestness, the wine left Saunders
Philipson entirely unaffected. His speech remained clear, with a sort
of musical, incisive clearness it always had, and the clarity with
which he unfolded his tale grew, if anything, as the night advanced.

'You are, I understand, pretty hard up at present, Mirlees?' he began,
coolly.

'That's so,' I replied, 'but I don't know how you came to understand
it.'

'Do not trouble to inquire. I know many things about many people that
would surprise them.' And with that he began to prove it, quoting facts
from my career since I had come East that I had thought unknown to
anybody but Ronald Mirlees.

'So you see,' he concluded, with a business-like pull at his glass, 'I
have a fair general idea of your status and antecedents. But it was
only last night I found out about you the fact that really concerns
me.'

'What was that?'

'That you are a comrade to be relied upon,' he said with the sincerest
and most matter-of-fact air in the world, 'and that you are free from
any absurd prejudice against the Asiatic as such.'

'What makes you think that?'

'Your actions have proved that you, at least, do not consider him less
worthy of consideration than a European. How many white men would have
stepped in to see fair play for a Chinese as you did last night?'

'Perhaps not many.'

'Very few indeed at the risk of their own lives. That fact alone would
have singled you out in my mind as the ideal man to help me.'

'What do you want me to do?'

'I want you to partner me in about the biggest adventure two men ever
undertook.'

'And you think I'd be more inclined to say yes because I'm on the
rocks?'

Philipson sat back in his chair with a frank smile. '_Touch√©!_' he
cried. 'I ought not to have mentioned the state of your finances, if
your being hard up disposes you to accept my offer, so much the better
for me, but candidly, I was not leaning on that. What I want is breadth
of mind, insight, sympathy, imagination. I can find any number of mere
situation hunters, but the man of sympathy is rare. To meet that man at
a moment when he is looking for an enterprise worthy of him I regard as
a piece of unparalleled good fortune. After all, why should you scrape
a livelihood writing for a public which can hardly understand you,
leave alone appreciate, when you might be bidding for real fame with
me?'

'You'd better let me have the story complete, Philipson,' I said.

'With all my heart. You had never heard of me before last night, I take
it?'

'Never.'

'It is not greatly to be wondered at. I have spent many years in the
East, but somehow the European centres never attracted me. Often I
have lived native for long periods together, and beyond the consuls
who have registered my name--though I never yet had to ask any other
service of them--I do not suppose a dozen men in all China know me.
Those that do, know me, I fear, only too well. The gentry who chased us
last night in the launch are among that number. But to my story. At one
time and another I have done much exploration in the interior. I have
been in many places where I am convinced no white man has been before
or since. The routes taken by travellers like Huc and Sven Hedin and
the Prince of Orleans across the so-called "unknown" regions of Tibet
I would guarantee to follow blindfold. There is not much to be found
up there except snow and ice and scenery--that is, at least, by people
who are obliged to hurry straight across, on the stretch about their
food supply all the while. If the climate and the nature of the country
allowed one time to explore, I fancy a lot of strange things would
turn up. I found something very strange indeed, but it was only by the
merest accident.'

'What was it?'

'An _obo_. You know what that is, of course?'

'A Tibetan prayer-mound, isn't it?'

'Exactly. They are to be found sometimes even in the uninhabited
regions, having been erected by pilgrims crossing the heights. The
_obo_ consists of slabs of slate--which often lies ready to hand on
the mountain sides--set up like a house of cards and inscribed all
over with Tibetan characters. Most European explorers who come upon
one of them for the first time imagine they have got hold of something
noteworthy, but disappointment awaits them. That historic record they
thought they had discovered turns out, on examination, to be no more
than an endless reiteration of the Tibetan devotional formula, _Om Mane
Padme Hum_--"O the Jewel of the Lotus."'

'Yet you say it was something strange you found?'

'It was, indeed. At first, of course, I thought I had merely stumbled
on one of those conventional monuments of piety, put up by some
pilgrim on his way to Lhassa from the north and no more distinctive
than a roadside crucifix in Italy. But then it struck me that this was
well off the route that any pilgrim would be likely to take. There
is no recognised track, of course, in those wild regions, but there
are long grooves between the ranges of heights, and it is to these
enormous gutters that the traveller keeps if he values his life. Even
here progress is arduous in the extreme, for the surface is terribly
rough even when free from ice-crusts, and many of the grooves run
for hundreds of miles at an altitude never less than sixteen thousand
feet, with the accompaniment of constant hailstorms and snowstorms and
terrific cold. The _obo_ I found was not in one of these gutters. It
stood on a small patch of level rock at the end of a pass, in the midst
of a waste of rugged peaks looking for all the world like monstrous
frozen waves of the sea.

'I saw beside the monument what appeared to be bleached sticks of
wood, but I discovered my mistake as I came nearer. They were human
bones--the skeleton of one man. Now thoroughly curious, I examined the
inscription on the plaques of slate, and you may picture my excitement
when I found it was not the usual text, but a longish legend scratched
on the surface with, apparently, some sharp splinter of rock. I at
once made an exact copy of the whole--no easy task, I may say, for
the scratches had been very feebly made. At that time I did not know
Tibetan well, but I knew enough to realise that this inscription had
been written by the dead man--and not long before his death, to judge
by the quavering way the letters were formed--for the purpose of
leaving some message behind him. But what the message was, neither I
nor any man of my party could fathom.

'That expedition was the most disastrous I ever knew. We had abominable
luck with the weather and everything else; snowstorms beleaguered us in
the mountains so long that our supplies ran out, and we were reduced
to living on steaks--raw for the most part--hacked from the ponies
as they dropped dead one by one. My bearers treacherously deserted
me, and when at last I, the only white man of the party, staggered
down into the Tsaidam marsh country with one faithful usbeg who had
accompanied me from Kashgar, the pair of us were much nearer dead than
alive.

'My first move after getting back to civilisation was to seek an
interpretation of that legend. There are one or two European works
on Tibetan, and I collected these and brushed up my knowledge of the
language thoroughly; but after much hard study I found I was still
unable to make sense of the inscription. The words were simple enough,
but they seemed to resolve into phrases that would not come out by
any ordinary method of translation. I could see far enough into the
fog, however, to understand that this legend had been composed by a
monk, and I assumed that the wording must be couched in some secret
phraseology known only to the Tibetan priesthood. Without special
knowledge I could get no further. What was I to do? I dared not show
the inscription to any Tibetan of my acquaintance, for I had already
a shrewd suspicion that it contained facts I should desire to keep to
myself.

'I bethought me of Lhassa, the headquarters of the Tibetan faith.
Thither I went, posing as a Chinese convert anxious to qualify for
monastic orders, and by virtue of a handsome solatium to the abbot
of a big monastery I gained admittance. There I learned many strange
things, Mirlees, but little that was of any use to me. Before long
I became convinced that the peculiar form of language in which my
legend had been written was not known at Lhassa. But the time I spent
there was not wasted. I discovered the monastic meaning of two vitally
important words in the inscription, which, translated into ordinary
Tibetan, came out as "Phagspa" and "Shigatse." That gave me the clue.
The legend had been written by a monk of the monastery of Phagspa, in
the city of Shigatse, and thither I must go for further enlightenment.
I went. Here I found far greater difficulty in obtaining admission, and
it was only by heavy bribery I was able to do so at all. Also, I was
obliged to take a vow to reside in that gloomy monastery for ever. All
went well for a while, and most hopefully for my quest. There _was_
a secret form of language used by the inmates of that place, and it
was not long before I began to acquire the elements of a vocabulary
in it. Yet despite my utmost care, I could not remain there without
arousing suspicion. From the questions I was obliged to ask, put them
as artlessly as I might, the monks soon gathered that there was some
ulterior motive in my coming, that I possessed a secret which they
would very strongly desire to discover. I was watched night and day.
The position became unbearable. At last one of the priests who had
been detailed to instruct me in the religious observances of the place
intruded on my privacy in a most exasperating fashion, and it ended in
blows. Several other monks came to this fellow's aid. Well, you have
seen me in a ruction, Mirlees. I seldom enter such an affair without
leaving my mark on it. I knocked down two of the Tibetan clergy and
threw a third against a great wooden pillar so violently that I fear he
perished as a result. That was the end of my novitiate as a lama. I had
to run, barely getting out with my life and the precious inscription,
which I always carried sewn into my inner garment.

'I pass over my escape back into China, which was a ghastly experience
enough, and took months of forced marches. But I had what I wanted.
Arrived in Shanghai, I sat down to translate my legend, and found
I could now piece it together without difficulty. And here is the
translation.'

Philipson took from his wallet a small folded slip, but paused before
flattening it out.

'I must have your solemn promise of secrecy, Mirlees,' he said. 'I
have risked my neck twice for this little handful of words, and I do
not choose to share it with any human soul besides yourself. Are you
agreeable?'

I gave the assurance he wanted, and Philipson, leaning over the table,
read in a clear whisper the following remarkable statement:

"I, Sbrang Chikya Lama, being a priest of the holy brotherhood of
Phagspa in the city of Shigatse, having now come to the end of this
incarnation, do hereby declare:

"That having strayed from the caravan in which I journeyed with others
despatched by the Ocean Priest" (Dalai Lama) "from Lhassa to the Son
of Heaven" (Emperor of China) "who holds sway in the north, I lost my
way in the mountains, and was mad with the madness of high places"
(height-sickness) "and came at last after many wanderings and grievous
pains to the land of the beings of ghostly face, who dwell by the river
of white gems under skies where birds fly bigger than the children of
men. And I descended into the valley which lies towards the setting
sun, but having seen from afar the beings of ghostly face and becoming
greatly afraid lest they, evil spirits, should enthral me to an evil
_karma_" (conduct of life) "I fled swiftly into the mountains again
ere they beheld me, and crossed again the great snows, hoping that in
time I might meet pilgrims of our own faith who should relieve me of my
distress. But I have seen no men, only the yak and the eternal snows,
and being now blinded with the snows and ready to die for want of food
and shelter, have written these words for warning lest any of the true
brotherhood should stray from this spot towards the setting sun and
should meet the devils of ghostly face and come to evil at their hands.

"Now to the Jewel of the Lotus I commend my spirit and pray I may
be born again in seemly shape and nearer to the blessed Nirvana"
(nothingness) "which sets a period upon life and death and rebirth."

Philipson carefully folded and replaced the paper, and looked
searchingly into my face.

'What do you make of that?' he said.

'About the queerest statement I ever came into contact with,' I
replied. 'How do you interpret it yourself?'

'I take it to mean that somewhere amongst those tremendous ranges there
is a valley of which the world so far knows nothing. Also that that
valley is inhabited.'

'By "devils of ghostly face"?'

'A white race might be called so by the writer of the legend.'

'H'm. A pretty tall order, Philipson,' I said. 'Where could they have
come from?'

'That remains for me to find out.'

'But what can the fellow have meant by birds bigger than the children
of men?'

'Possibly some great vulture or eagle which he had never seen in his
own country. You must remember the poor wretch had been wandering
alone over the mountains--for how long we don't know, and that he was
starving and exhausted. No doubt to his fevered eyes the birds looked a
good deal bigger than they really were.'

'But the river of white gems?'

'Ah, there we come to a real difficulty. I have pondered that phrase
for weeks together, and the only explanation I can think of is this:
the strayed priest struck a mountain stream, which he could see flowed
down into the valley, and knelt beside it to drink. It must have been
then that he noticed the white gems in the water, and the white gems, I
take it, must have lain thick for him to notice them at all.'

'What do you suppose the white gems to be?'

'There is only one kind of white gem that is found in the beds of
streams, Mirlees--the diamond. That one fact ought to render this
valley a highly attractive locality, though for my part I may say I
intend to explore it quite independently of the hope of opening up a
new diamond field.'

'If there were diamonds there, isn't it likely the priest would have
brought some away with him?'

'He may have done so. I noticed none near the skeleton, but then I was
not looking for anything of the sort, and may easily have missed them.
He may have dropped them during his retreat through the mountains.
Likeliest of all, he may have been too terrified at the sight of the
"devils of ghostly face" to trouble about collecting gems.'

I sat drumming my fingers on the table. It was a wild and fantastic
enough story in all conscience, and they would be bold gamblers who
staked much on its truth.

'Well, what do you say?' I heard Philipson's crisp, keen voice.

'I see pretty enormous obstacles. In the first place, supposing you
could find the place where the legend was written--'

'Never fear. I nearly lost my life on that trip, but I kept my head
through it all. I made a large-scale plan of the neighbourhood, and
mapped every mile of my journey down country. I will guarantee to take
you to that heap of slates direct--or as straight as the mountains
permit.'

'How is it, then, if the place is so easy to find, it's never been
found and made known? I've trekked with the Tibetan caravans before
now, many times, but never have I heard mention of such a monument.'

'You hardly would. My _obo_ is right off the track that caravans or
even explorers would be likely to follow. Even if the heap of slates
were found, that would not help in the least. I was determined that
if there were any great discovery to be made beyond those mountains
it should be mine only. As soon as I had copied the inscription I
erased it. As it stands at this moment, that cairn would be taken to be
just the common type of Tibetan _obo_ with its legend obliterated by
weather.'

'You seem to meet every objection, Philipson,' I said. 'But frankly, as
man to man, do you really expect to find this supposed valley with its
white race?'

'Why not? If that poor devil of a priest could find it, travelling
alone and on foot, without equipment and without food, it will say
little for my capabilities as an explorer if I cannot do as much with
all the outfit for a cross-mountain expedition. Whatever happens,
I shall never rest now till I have settled the question one way or
the other, or left my bones up on those heights in the attempt. Why,
Mirlees, an adventure like this is worth risking a dozen lives for. It
will be the most wonderful exploration in history.'

Saunders Philipson's manner was always openness itself, yet had he
deliberately sought around for the most cunning way to win me over
he couldn't have brought forward a stronger argument than this. The
lure of the thing was irresistible. Already I saw myself bringing
back the secret of this hidden land to the outer world, and heard
my name ringing round the planet, and saw the faces of some of my
former critics among the orientalists. These folk had set me down as a
reckless liar in the past. Now they would have something really to get
excited about.

'I'm in it with you Philipson,' I said at last, 'in it to the death.
But there's the rub--the possible death. Nasty accidents have been
known to happen up on that roof of the world. I haven't money enough to
pay the lawyer's fee for writing a will, but there are some manuscripts
among my baggage that I don't want lost, still less stolen and printed
under another man's name. I'd give a good deal to return to Shanghai
before we start.'

Philipson shook his head gravely. 'Most perilous,' he said. 'The gang
we escaped last night will know at any moment now that the down coast
scent was false--if indeed they have not learned as much already. They
will concentrate on Shanghai till a fresh trail is picked up. For
either of us to show his face in the city at present would be suicidal.'

'By the way, Philipson, who _are_ the gang?'

'H'm. Of course. I did not tell you. They are members, Mirlees, of
a large and powerful secret society, whose headquarters are at the
monastery of Shigatse, in Tibet. During my novitiate I gathered that
there was something of the sort in existence, though no mention of
it was ever made to me. I fancy it started there centuries ago, as a
purely religious organisation, but that it has since extended over
China and taken on a character the very reverse of religious, though
it still preserves the ancient hidden form of language which was used
by Sbrang Chikya on the _obo_. I have been able to discover one or two
things about the society since my return to Shanghai, but I little
dreamed its agents were actually in the city and had marked me down for
destruction.'

'You're sure of that?'

'I recognised one of my former fellow monks during our encounter in the
opium hell.'

'What were you after there?'

'Facts. Since I got the translation of the legend I have been
constantly on the look out for confirmation of it, however slight. It
seemed impossible that a race like this people of the legend should
lie hidden in their valley through the centuries without at least some
vague tradition of their existence developing in neighbouring lands. I
had heard of no such tradition, but other men might. I made veiled but
thorough inquiries among natives who have used the caravan routes of
the interior a good deal, and at last came upon a man who professed to
know something about it. We were to meet in that den, then go on to his
house. I now see the whole scheme. The monks at Shigatse had divined
from certain questions I put to them that I was on the track of some
land of gems in the interior, which had originally been discovered by
one of their own fraternity. They wanted to filch my information and
revenge themselves upon me for entering their monastery and penetrating
some of _their_ secrets under false pretences. The fellow who was
to give me information was put up as a trap, to get hold of this
inscription and these--'

Philipson threw himself back in his chair, staring at the wall above
my head. He then began feverishly turning over the papers he had drawn
from his wallet.

'What's wrong?' I cried.

Philipson glared at me in a sort of suppressed fury. 'This is wrong,
Mirlees,' he muttered between his teeth. 'The man you are partnering
yourself with is about the clumsiest fool in Asia. When I came away
from my house I thought I had all my papers with me. But I had not. One
packet is missing--the one containing half the maps of my journey down
country.'

'That's essential, of course?'

'Vital. It's this end of the trail I've left behind. The other I might
dispense with--with extreme good luck I might find the _obo_ from
memory if I had a correct start. As it is, I would not guarantee to get
within a hundred miles of it.'

'H'm. Perhaps you'd better let me risk Shanghai after all, Philipson,'
I said. 'I could get the maps as well as settle my own affairs.'

He remained staring at the wall. 'Plucky of you to volunteer, Mirlees,'
he said at last, 'but if either of us is to go, I might every bit as
well go myself. Both of us would stand an excellent chance of being
murdered.'

At this moment there was a violent commotion outside our room.
Philipson shot the papers back into his pocket and sprang up, covering
the door with a revolver, as I could see, through the silk of his
jacket. We heard scuffling footsteps and the voice of the Chinese
landlady raised in strident wrath. Philipson tiptoed to the door,
opened it quietly, and peered out, while I followed him, peeping over
his shoulder. With the woman was a boy of about twenty-one, in Europe
clothes and, apparently, a genial phase of alcohol, bowing and scraping
to her like a dancing master and talking a sort of high-falutin jargon
of which she couldn't possibly have understood two words.

When he had satisfied himself there was nobody else, Philipson stepped
out on to the broad landing, with me at his heels. The newcomer turned
and faced us. He was short, well-knit, clad in smartly cut pongees that
had suffered a little, it seemed, from his adventures of the evening;
and as he bowed to us--with just a suspicion of a lurch--his regular,
freckled features broke into a smile that disclosed two rows of very
small white teeth. Whatever the fellow was, he was no hobo--that much I
saw at once.

'Good evening, gentlemen,' he said. 'Would you believe it, this
flinty-hearted Hebe actually denies me access to my own rooms!'

The proprietress likewise turned to us, with shrill protest. 'Dis man
he no hab pay money!' she screamed. 'No more long time can stay in dis
house.'

The youth threw up his hands disdainfully, as if surprised. 'How
paltry!' he exclaimed. 'To break the harmony of our relations over a
few wretched dollars which I do not for the moment happen to possess!'

Philipson had been taking stock of the youth very comprehensively,
though he didn't appear to be aware of it.

'What's your name?' demanded my friend.

The newcomer returned Philipson's keen look with equal directness,
raising his eyebrows slightly. 'Abruptly asked, if I may say so,' he
remarked. 'My name is Stephen Poyning, at your service'--and with this
he fetched a rather grandiose sweep of the topee he was holding in his
hand.

'How much do you owe her?'

Poyning faced the landlady. 'Prithee, woman,' he said, 'state the
extent of indebtedness.'

'Dis man he no hab pay fifty dollar!' she returned.

Philipson pulled a wad of notes from his pocket, counted out five of
ten dollars each, pushed them into the landlady's hand and took her
by the shoulders and directed her downstairs with a good deal more
determination than gallantry.

'Now, sir,' he said, turning to Poyning, 'having relieved your
immediate needs, I venture to inquire what is your business here.'

Poyning fanned himself elegantly with his hat. 'There lies the whole
pathos of the situation,' he said. 'I have none. My occupation up to
this time has been merely the search for business, the quest of some
small nook in the great world machine of labour. I may say that the
quest has been diligently prosecuted, but utterly barren of result.'

'H'm. You cannot get a job.'

'The merchant princes of this land, sir, have been but very faintly
impressed with the desirability of enlisting my services. In
Shanghai--would you credit it?--I could scarce get them to believe I
was not in jest; and here, too, beyond the offer of a post to pack
frozen game in a warehouse--side by side, I believe, with native
operatives--nothing whatever has presented itself. And I, gentlemen,
took a first at the University of Oxford.'

'Come into this room,' said Philipson, leading the way.

Poyning followed. On seeing the quartette of bottles on the table his
eyes lit up. 'One who understands the art of living, I observe,' he
said. 'And now, worthy Macedonian, what can I do to vent my gratitude
for your most timely loan?'

Philipson was staring at the youth very hard. 'Gift,' he corrected,
shortly. 'Usury is not among my failings.'

Poyning bowed again. 'And a bourgeois pride is not among mine,' he
said. 'Gift be it called, then, which is the more noble, and moves me
to livelier thanks. How can I translate them into action?'

'Wait here for a few moments,' said Philipson, moving suddenly to the
door. 'Stay in this room, the pair of you, till I come back.'

As soon as he was gone I motioned our visitor to a chair. 'You're a
pretty cool hand,' I said. 'D'you always call people fancy names?'

'The wrathful Hebe, cupbearer to gods? The appellation was perhaps
rather daring than apt.'

'For some reason best known to yourself you also called my friend
"worthy Macedonian."'

He screwed a glass into his eye and rounded on me with an expression of
astonishment--whether feigned or genuine I couldn't tell.

'Dear me,' he said, 'can it be that the allusion was lost upon you? And
yet you would appear from your externals to be a man of some culture.'

'May be,' I said, nettled at his bland impudence, 'but what has that to
do with it?'

'Possibly your studies have at some time or other taken you into that
temple of learning known as the British Museum?'

'They have, but I still don't see what the devil you're driving at.'

'Curious,' observed Poyning. 'The Grecian type of your friend's
beauty--our friend's, if I may say so--is so marked that it struck
me at once. An idle fancy of mine, of course, but the reason I
addressed him as worthy Macedonian was that his features bear a perfect
resemblance to the busts of Alexander the Great.'




                              CHAPTER IV

                     THE QUEER EPISODE AT NANKING


It was such a far-fetched observation to make that I thought the boy
must be more elevated than he looked, but if he was, he could at least
keep himself in hand. Finding me silent, he made no advance from his
side, but took a cigarette from his own case and lit it; and there we
sat smoking in silence until Philipson returned.

The moment he entered the room I could see by his face that he had
taken one of those sudden resolves I was already beginning to get
accustomed to.

'So you have been looking for work, Poyning,' he began, 'and you have
found none?'

Poyning solemnly inclined his head. 'The dismal situation is as I
have already painted it,' he said. 'You gentlemen, no doubt skilled
observers of the East and its peculiarities, can perhaps suggest the
reason of my failure? Tell me, is there anything in my appearance that
might be expected to militate against success?'

Philipson seemed to find this funny, for I noticed he was biting his
lip when he answered. 'If you will allow me to say so, Poyning,' he
said, 'you are about the last type in the world the merchant princes of
this country are looking for. Still, there are other employers besides
the merchant princes. Perhaps I can offer you something to go on with.
Would you care to earn a thousand dollars?'

'By any task a man of delicacy may fittingly undertake.'

'It is certainly a matter of delicacy--so much so that I must stipulate
for absolute secrecy before I let you hear a word about it. Will you
swear?'

'By all the powers of beauty and light!' said Stephen Poyning, so
religiously that you might have thought he was going to cross himself.

'It is also a matter of extreme danger.'

'Not more perilous, I fancy,' returned Poyning suavely, 'than the
grisly spectre of starvation which hangs over me at this moment.'

It was, as I say, a high-falutin manner of talk that this little
exquisite used, but there was something in his demeanour that soon made
me begin to have hopes of him; and I believe Philipson had come to
similar conclusions a good deal quicker than I had.

'Very well,' he said. 'The business is this. We two have vitally
important affairs to transact in Shanghai, but it is not feasible for
either of us to return in person. Our matters must be seen to through
an agent, and even he, I may tell you at the outset, stands quite a
good chance of coming to grief at the hands of the same men who will
be on the watch for us.'

Poyning clasped and unclasped his small womanly hands. 'It sounds by
far the most interesting thing I have yet heard in China,' he mused.

'Now listen closely,' said Philipson, 'for I am going to give you your
instructions. The people of this inn think we are on a pleasure trip
from Hankow, and you must do nothing to undeceive them. You will slip
out secretly to the railway station and catch the down train, which
leaves this place at midnight. That will get you into Shanghai by seven
in the morning. It is probable that the station will be watched, so
be on your guard. You will let your ricsha-boy pull you away in the
direction of the European quarter--which he will do of his own accord
since you are a foreigner--but not until you come to the river will you
tell him to go to the Marco Polo Hotel, and not too loudly then. That
is where my friend was staying before we left. You will clean up and
have breakfast, then see the manager in your own room and explain to
him that my friend has been called away to Canton on urgent business
and that you have come to settle his account, pack his belongings,
and put them into store. My friend will give you a note and detailed
instructions as to what he wants done. This will take you till ten
o'clock. You will then go out and buy a good second-hand suit case
without any initials on it--or at least you must studiously avoid one
with your own.'

Poyning had sat quite still, with an air of some concentration. He now
looked up inquiringly.

'Because your initials happen to be the same as my own,' added
Philipson rather brusquely. 'Saunders Philipson is my name, and my
friend is Ronald Mirlees--so steer clear of R.M. too. You will then
go to Obermeyers, on the Bund, and buy a good chronometer and a
sextant. You will then go to the Bank of Cathay, where you will cash
a big cheque for me--or rather exchange it for a letter of credit on
the Bank's Chungking branch: I will give you a note to the manager.
You will then return to the Marco Polo Hotel and confine yourself to
your room till after dark. Then take a ricsha down to Bubbling Well
and proceed to the New Highgate Road on foot. The last bungalow on
the right hand side is mine. You will approach with extreme caution,
taking particular care that you are not shadowed. Go not to the front
door, but to the side, and give five sharp taps--like this.' Philipson
knocked with his knuckles on the table, repeating the signal twice.
'My boy, Lo Eng, will let you in. He speaks good English, so you will
have no difficulty with him. You will tell him I have gone away for an
indefinite period, and that he is to shut the house and return to his
people; if he does not hear from me in six months, he is to hand over
my belongings to the manager of the Bank of Cathay, who is my executor.
Lo Eng is to give you a packet of papers marked "B," and in proof of
good faith you will show him this seal. You will then get away from
the bungalow unobserved, return to the hotel and settle up there, and
catch the eleven o'clock train back. It is of the utmost life-and-death
urgency that nobody should trace you from my house to the station or
from the station here. Is that clear?'

'Lucid as Helicon itself,' said Poyning, removing his eyeglass and
wiping it with a handkerchief of perfumed silk.

'Then let me hear what you are going to do.'

It surprised me a little to hear Philipson make this demand. He had
rattled off his string of orders so fast that I expected he would at
least give the youth something in writing, however cryptic, to remember
them by. But my real surprise came when Poyning recited the whole, not
only accurately, but, as far as I could myself remember, in Philipson's
own words.

The latter sprang to his feet. 'Excellent,' he said. 'You already
begin to justify my belief in your capability. Those are your marching
orders, then. Carry them out as exactly as you have rehearsed them, and
payment awaits you on your return.'

'If I might suggest two amendments--' began Poyning.

'What do you mean?'

'This. My own rooms in Shanghai are still, I regret to say, unsettled
for. I propose to utilise part of the day in closing them. For this
purpose I should be glad of certain of those thousand dollars in
advance. The opportunity of withdrawing from that hub of commerce
in strict honour and solvency may not present itself to me again,
gentlemen. It must be grasped now.'

'Then you are not going back to Shanghai eventually?'

'I do not regard that as at all probable.'

'What are you going to do here?'

'I was not, to tell the truth, proposing to remain in this picturesque
but somewhat unpromising field of labour, either.'

'Indeed. Well, it is no affair of mine, Poyning, but if I could put
you in the way of a berth, I would--particularly if you carry out this
commission of mine satisfactorily. Have you any idea _what_ you are
going to do?'

Poyning's small freckled features wrinkled into a grin. 'I think it is
more than possible,' he said, 'that I shall accompany you to Chungking
and those more distant regions which you will be visiting in the near
future.'

Philipson set down his glass with a clatter. 'What the devil do you
know about our intentions?' he said sharply.

'I pretend to no exact knowledge,' replied Poyning, waving his
small hand, 'but I should be dull indeed if I had gathered no
inkling from what you have told me. You see, Philipson, I'm no fool,
though my classical qualifications may not seem an asset in the
pork-packing circles where I have vainly hawked them. You are going to
Chungking--your letter of credit betrays as much. But the amount of the
cheque which you will give me to change and the length of time you will
be away seem to me to indicate that your true objective lies beyond
that port: that you have, in fact, some rather considerable expedition
in view.'

'Suppose we have. What use do you think you could be to us?'

'There, again, a little elementary thought solves the conundrum for
me. The fact that you are obliged to take such detailed precautions
in order to get away from this area with a whole skin argues that you
would be none the worse for the company and support of a person who,
though he should not be the one to proclaim it, is a good shot with
small arms and no worse afflicted with cowardice than most.'

'I see,' said Philipson, drily, glancing at the watch on his wrist.
'_We_ are to benefit by the arrangement, eh?'

'To the extent I have indicated,' retorted Poyning, quite unabashed.
'My profit from the enterprise, on the other hand, will be co-equal
with yours. The great wildernesses of earth, gentlemen, have always
called to me, and those lands which you are going to visit beyond
Chungking will answer very nicely, I've no doubt, to the description
of a wilderness. I would go forth into it with you. If you gratify my
ambition, there is _my_ half of our mutual gain.'

Philipson looked at his watch again. 'No time to go into the matter
now, anyway,' he said. 'You must catch to-night's train without fail. I
will get ready the things you are to take, and Mirlees will tell you in
the meantime what he wants done in Shanghai.'

While Philipson was busy at a side table with pen and ink, I gave
Poyning my instructions for the safeguarding of my slender properties.
He listened quietly, repeated word for word what I had said, and tapped
his forehead as a man might the lid of a cash-box after locking away
valuable securities in it.

'Now, Poyning,' said our leader, returning to the middle of the room,
'here is money for your expenses and purchases, the note to my bank,
the cheque, and my seal. I am also advancing you two hundred dollars
out of your honorarium. That enough? Right. As to whether you join
forces with us for good, I say nothing yet. I like the look of you and
I like the sound of you, but I do not take you right into my concerns
until I have some solid proof of your steel. Get away to Shanghai and
bring off these commissions successfully, and I shall be open to admit
that you are a man worth my while taking on a mission which, to say no
more of it, will want men of no ordinary temper. Good luck and God be
with you!'

Poyning took his leave of us much in the grand manner, but as I looked
at his face it seemed to me that underneath that mask of the exquisite
there was something of shrewdness and sand that would go a long way and
not be lightly turned back. He slid quietly downstairs and we heard no
more of him. Soon after he had gone I went along to my bedroom--for I
was dog-tired--leaving Philipson deep in thought and the contemplation
of two fresh bottles of wine which he had had brought up.

And now I come to the first of those mysterious episodes that happened
on our journey up country and bear, as I now see, so profoundly on
the queer adventures we were to meet with afterwards. I have made my
account of this with great care and constant reference to the very
clear recollection of the event my memory retains; and I don't think
that in what follows there is one jot more or less than I actually
observed.

I don't know whether it was because of the heat, which was steamy and
penetrating, or because of the mosquitoes that had already come up in
clouds from the swampy land bordering the creek; but weary as I was,
I couldn't sleep a wink. I lay tossing and turning and going over in
my mind our jumpy experiences of the past forty-eight hours, and the
longer I lay, the more feverishly alert I grew. Every noise of the
night, the mumble of talk from the servants' quarters at the far end
of the inn, an occasional clanging ricsha-bell away in the city, the
screech of an early cicada on the lawns, even the subtle hiss of water
among the roots of the willows beneath our wall--all came to my ears
magnified about fourfold. When Philipson withdrew to his bedroom some
hours after I had left him, the noise he made was relatively deafening.
I heard him throw himself on to the bed with a jangle of springs, and
then lay dozing, praying for sleep but more honestly inclined to swear
at my insomnia.

At last, opening my eyes, I saw there was a curious light outside the
window, so bright that at first I thought some native house on the
other side of the creek must be going up in flames. I got out of bed
and looked on to the verandah that ran along outside our wing of the
inn. Then I saw where the illumination came from: it was the moon, full
and brilliant, which had climbed round to that side of the building
and was bathing the creek in a glory of silver and gold. Without the
distraction of stewy heat and savage mosquitoes it would have been a
picture to paint or write poetry about.

Then, suddenly, I became conscious of voices farther along the
verandah. I couldn't distinguish the words, but I knew at once the
language was not English. Nor was it any dialect of Chinese I ever
struck, and I have heard and spoken most. All caution drowned in a
prickling curiosity, I stepped noiselessly out on to the verandah
and peeped round the jutting stone jamb of the window. Now I saw the
speakers, and at the sight I could have cried out in my astonishment.
There were two figures, a man and a woman. The former looked to me
uncommonly like Saunders Philipson, dressed as I had left him a few
hours before. The real stunning surprise for me, however, was in the
appearance of the woman. She was no dusky, cramp-footed native, but
manifestly European, tall, queenly, with bare head and loose gown, and
so far as I could distinguish her features, of a remarkable beauty.

I drew back into cover of my window and stood there with thumping
heart, a pitiful mess of indecision. Philipson was, as I had already
learned, a queer fellow. He had betrayed pronounced eccentricity
in the direction of strong drink; now I saw him in his even queerer
relations with women. Who the beautiful stranger was or whence she
came, I couldn't conceive, but it seemed plain enough she must have
been there by assignation. She could only have got on to that verandah
through his sleeping chamber, for I had heard Philipson lock the door
of the sitting room before he retired, and I had certainly been too
wide awake for anybody to pass through my room without my knowledge,
even had the door not been secure on the inside, which it was. There
was no other way.

What should I do? If this was merely some clandestine romance of
Philipson's, I had a shrewd notion he would take any interference
from me vastly amiss, perhaps even to the length of breaking with me.
And yet I had to admit that the time, and our circumstances, seemed
strangely out of tune with secret love affairs. A sudden fear took hold
of me. I had already seen Philipson once the victim of treachery. Could
it be that our enemies had discovered our whereabouts and set another
snare, this time in more crafty and seductive shape?

What I should have done I don't know, but at that moment there was
a gentle knock at the bedroom door. This clinched my suspicions. I
snatched up a revolver and faced round, demanding who was there. No
answer came, but the knock was repeated. Then I realised that it was
the peculiar five taps--Philipson's own code--that had been given. I
tiptoed to the door, unbolted and pulled it ajar, covering the aperture
with my gun. An instant later I had lowered the muzzle, for there
stood Ah Sing, shivering and hoarse with excitement.

'Hab look-see master him window,' he whispered, stabbing with his
finger in the direction of Philipson's room. 'Him talkee-talkee some
_tai-tai_ my no sabbee. My no likum dat. My tinkee him talkee-talkee
some dam bad man him come hit master one big whop!'

Ah Sing, then, from his post on board the launch, had also observed
this mysterious visitor, and to his faithful mind had occurred at once
the same suspicion of a decoy. That decided me. I would risk any row
with Philipson rather than let him be held in talk on the verandah
while all kinds of villainy might be hatching behind him. I peered
along the shadowy landing, but could see nobody. Perhaps already an
enemy had gained entrance to Philipson's bedroom, where no doubt his
precious papers were left unguarded.

Followed by Ah Sing, I ran along to the door and listened. There was
no sound whatever. I tried the door: it was locked. I rapped, using
Philipson's knock, first softly, then louder, and at last called him by
name. There was no reply. Now thoroughly scared, I sent Ah Sing round
through my bedroom to warn his master from that side. He was back at my
side a few seconds later, his eyes staring, his mouth agape.

'Hab look-see master no hab see!' he panted.

It was at this instant that something inside the bedroom moved. I heard
a soft, uneven step, the key was turned in the lock, the door came
slightly open, and the muzzle of a revolver appeared round the style.
I sang out sharply:

'Philipson!'

One instant after that the door was swung wide, and we stood face to
face. I say we stood, though it would be nearer truth to say that I, at
least, staggered.

Philipson was in pyjamas. His hair was tousled down over his face and
his eyes, which he rather dazedly rubbed with his free fist, were
blinking and heavy-lidded, as of a man just roused from deep sleep.




                               CHAPTER V

                    THE MISSION OF STEPHEN POYNING


For the better part of a minute my tongue simply refused duty. I could
no more than stand and gape, while the blood buzzed in my ears and the
dim-lit doorway of Philipson's room seemed to rock sideways. Like words
spoken in a dream I heard Philipson demand what was up, and Ah Sing's
quaint pidgin-English as he panted out his version of the story.

Philipson started back as if he had been struck. His face was in
shadow, but I had an impression that his features were working, the
way of a man not quite in command of himself. That lasted for only
a few seconds, however. When he spoke again it was in the brisk,
matter-of-fact tones he would have used to order a fresh can of
lubricant for the launch.

'Odd,' he muttered. 'Odd, and nasty in the extreme! God knows who those
people could have been. I had reckoned with a native organisation,
Mirlees, but nothing more. If there are Europeans in it too--'

'Then it--'

I broke off suddenly. Neither then nor thereafter could I imagine what
it was, but something from outside myself seemed to close my lips
by force, and there came down over my brain a most uncanny sense of
hesitation and bewilderment.

We had all three rushed out on to the verandah, and stood listening,
peering out and around in every direction. There was no sound, no sign
of movement anywhere; the creek lay like a riband of orange-tinted
silver in the staring moonlight, from Nanking itself came scarcely a
murmur of noise. It was the short hour when even a vast Chinese city is
quiet between the clamour of two days.

Ah Sing kept watch for the rest of that night, but there was hardly
need--I remained vividly awake myself every minute of the time. In the
morning I rose so utterly limp that Philipson diagnosed fever from the
mosquitoes--which had bitten us both pretty voraciously--and dosed
me with a quinine mixture into which I suspect he had dropped some
pleasant opiate. At any rate, it wiped the restlessness out of me as if
with a sponge, and I slept sound till lunch.

But if I was below par, Philipson himself seemed at the very pitch of
his form, alert, vigorous, in the best of spirits. He busied himself
at the table with maps and calculations and expense-sheets, and from
an occasional remark he rapped out to me I knew he was in a downright
itch for the hour of Poyning's return. The one thing that seemed equal
to allaying his impatience during that day of forced delay was wine.
Saunders Philipson consumed, I believe, seven bottles between breakfast
and dinner time, and the proprietress was already predicting the
exhaustion of her modest cellar.

Neither Philipson nor I alluded once to the episode of last night,
yet I fancy it was in the thoughts of both of us. From time to time
throughout the day he would shoot sudden glances towards the balcony,
as if the affair had occurred to his mind; and I couldn't help
connecting his overpowering excitement of to-day with what had happened
in the night watches. For my part, I could think of little else. That
two strangers should have gained access to the verandah without our
hearing them approach was hardly less a matter for surprise than alarm.
An active man might, it's true, have shinned up the wooden pillars and
drawn his accomplice after him with a cord, yet even this supposition
seemed wild enough to me when I remembered that one of the intruders
was a woman. Or at least, I could have sworn at the time that it was
a woman. Could it be the whole thing was an illusion--that I was half
asleep when I looked out, and that my dreaming eyes had turned some
short-coated Chinaman into Saunders Philipson and his taller accomplice
into that mysterious lady of the long robe? If so, it was an astounding
coincidence that both Ah Sing and myself should fall into the same
remarkable error. Then again, who were these prowlers of the night?
It wasn't like the enemies we had known--to be scared off by the mere
sound of our voices, yet that alone is what could have happened. While
we were talking at Philipson's door, they must have taken fright and
escaped down the balcony pillars and right round the hotel by way of
the water's edge. This might even have been done with the connivance
of those inside, and there recurred rather significantly to my mind
Philipson's remark that the proprietress of the inn would want watching.

Altogether, it was about as dark and mysterious a business as you could
well conceive, and I was glad, after tiffin, of a relief from puzzling
over it any longer. Philipson began to communicate his plans to me, to
outline the route he proposed we should take, and to go into details
of equipment, service and cost. As I listened to his quiet, confident
words and followed the lines he drew across the map with such assurance
and evidently first-hand knowledge of the country it represented,
my own nerves forsook me, and before long I felt as confident and
enthusiastic as himself. That was always the way with Saunders
Philipson. His enthusiasm was more than contagious, it was epidemic;
and he seemed to be gifted with so keen a zest of life that he spoke
with enthusiasm of any subject he judged worth speaking about at all.

We dared not go out of the inn, of course, or even away from our wing
of it. Meals were brought up to the sitting room, while Ah Sing fed
himself in the cabin of the launch. The engineer-cook had come for
orders that morning, and I could see that he, like myself, preserved
an uneasy recollection of last night. There was fear in his eyes, the
vague terror of a man who is frightened of something to which he cannot
give a name; and it was not until Philipson took him by the shoulders
and shook him and ordered him with fatherly severity not to be a
gaping fool that the normal grin of adoration came back into Ah Sing's
face. Then he went about his business and took, as I thought, a sound
common-sense refuge from his terrors in hard work. Whenever I looked
down from our verandah during the day I saw Ah Sing pottering to and
fro with broom and rag, scouring the already speckless launch till she
shone again.

I turned in after dinner for a little sleep against the watches we were
to stand through the night. This programme of Philipson's we carried
out, but with no recurrence of the alarm. Ah Sing remained on guard
on the deck of the launch till one, then came up to wake Philipson,
who stood a trick till four, rousing me at that hour to see us safely
through the twilit marches of dawn. At about half-past six o'clock I
was putting on a last pipe before breakfast when I heard a step along
the landing, and Philipson entered my room.

'If he has succeeded,' he burst out abruptly, 'he will be here at any
minute, and we shall start to-night with the fall of dusk. If not--'

'You think he's likely to have failed?'

'Honestly, I do not. I liked that boy from the moment I set eyes on
him. That is why I took the trouble to verify his pretensions. I had
collected all the available information about Stephen Poyning within
five minutes of seeing him.'

Philipson stepped out through my window and walked to the end of the
verandah, where it was blocked in by a cheek of brick wall. He peeped
stealthily round the angle, then started back.

'Coming!' he muttered.

I took Philipson's place and a peep for myself. From this point a
stretch of the winding creekside road into the city was visible, and
along it, at a distance, I saw a ricsha approach at the walk. In it sat
a huddled figure I recognised as Stephen Poyning. The road was already
crowded with native traffic, but as I continued to look I noticed
another ricsha, about a hundred yards farther off, which seemed to be
keeping the first in sight and regulating its pace so as to remain at
an even lapse behind.

'He's being followed,' I said.

Philipson pulled me away and stared eagerly round the angle of the
building. For a few moments he watched, intently silent, and when he
drew back it was with an expression of mingled seriousness and relief.

'You recognise the man behind?' he queried.

I took a closer look. 'Eh? Isn't it--'

'Lo Eng. My number-one boy. Something has gone awry. Also, Poyning is
hurt--there is a bandage under that topee of his.'

We stepped back into the sitting room, where Philipson swiftly laid out
a small surgical outfit and summoned a servant, bidding him fetch hot
water. The boy who brought it had hardly disappeared when there were
heavy, ill-guided steps on the stairs without, and Poyning, pale as a
corpse, his pongees plastered with mud and dust, staggered in. He set
down a suitcase he was carrying, wincingly removed his helmet, and sank
into a chair.

Philipson laid a gentle hand on his shoulder. 'Not a word, young man,'
he said, 'till I have plugged that hole in your head.'

Poyning's white features broke into a drawn grin. 'Bacchus before
√Üsculapius, my dear sir,' he said. 'Give me a drink!'

I mixed him a stiff champagne and brandy, which he swallowed at a
go, and then Philipson, with the speed and firm skill of a surgeon
and more than a woman's tenderness, bathed and dressed an ugly gash
over the boy's forehead. He lay back for some moments with his eyes
closed, while a spot of colour came slowly into his cheeks; then sat up
and demanded a cigarette, which having received and lighted, Stephen
Poyning plunged without further ado into his tale. Lo Eng had meanwhile
entered the room. Philipson pointed to a chair, on the edge of which he
sat, demurely listening.

'I reached Shanghai North Station at about half-past seven yesterday
morning,' began Poyning. 'If there was one native watching the gates,
there were a dozen, but these people all seemed to be there on
legitimate business--I certainly saw no sign of any of them following
me. I got to the Marco Polo Hotel in the unobtrusive manner prescribed
by you, cleaned off the travel stains, took nourishment, invited the
manager to my room, and settled Mirlees' debt. The manager seemed, if
I may say so, relieved to see his money. The instructions regarding
your manuscripts, Mirlees, have been carried out to the letter, and
your other treasures are stored in the warehouse next door; here are
the keys, and the receipts for your chattels and your accommodation
charges. Here, Philipson, are receipted bills for the chronometer
and sextant, which you will find in that suit case--intact, I trust,
though it must be confessed they received some brusque jolts during
the later developments of my adventure. Here is the letter of credit
on Chungking, which the manager of the Cathay Bank made out in his
private sanctum and handed to me with very excellent good luck to you,
Philipson, and a hope that the inquiries from your well-wishers in
Shanghai would not prove too searching. I did not, to be candid, know
what in Hades he was driving at, but I winked in the sophisticated
manner of one who did, and the genial financier seemed very well
satisfied.'

Philipson whistled softly. We exchanged glances.

'I pass,' resumed Poyning, 'to the really momentous phase of the
expedition.

'I left the hotel at half-past eight, when twilight was falling--as the
late Tennyson sang--and reached the fair pleasaunces of Bubbling Well
about half an hour afterwards. Here I dismissed my ricsha-coolie, much
to his chagrin--it was ten minutes, in fact, before I could shake the
ardent fellow off--and loitered along waiting for a suitable person to
ask my way. This took some time, as all the white community seemed to
be at mess, and I deemed it impolitic to seek guidance from a native.
At last I got the required direction, and struck out on foot. I had
not marched far down the New Highgate Road before I saw that I was
followed. It was a Chinese, a pretty well-nourished subject of medium
stature, who dogged my steps, keeping about twenty yards behind. He
made no attempt to conceal himself, and when I drew up short, came
straight on.

'"You wanchee find some housum dis road?" he said, debonairly enough.
"My gib you look-a-look anybody housum. My sabbee anybody housum allee
same-same."

'"Very obliging of you," I said, "but who might you be?"

'"My b'long Misser Philipson numbah-one boy," he said. "Him housum burn
down so my no hab housum lib jus' now."'

Philipson whistled again, louder.

'"You sabbee Misser Philipson?" continued my would-be cicerone. "You
sabbee where him gone jus' now?"

'"Never heard of him," I said. "What's your name?"

'"My b'long all same Lo Eng," replied the fellow, with an expansion of
his already wide mouth. "My wanchee sabbee where master hab gone. Jus'
now no can tell him him housum burn down."

'Well, gentlemen, God knows I am no purist, but I could not bring
myself to regard that man's conversational style as good English--which
you told me Lo Eng spoke. He had given the name correctly, true, but
I remained profoundly unsatisfied with his bona fides. I got rid of
him, strode on down the road, and soon came to a house which had been
gutted. Yes, alas, Philipson, it was only too true. Standing guard in
the road were two Sikh policemen, whose presence had the desirable
effect of finally scaring away my plausible informant--or so I thought.
He had followed me thus far, but when I looked round a moment later he
had melted into the atmosphere. I walked on briskly, came to a bend
in the road, and sprinted down it on noiseless toes. It had occurred
to me that I might get to the house from across the fields behind it
without apprising the Law; and this I was able to do, though I could
have wished for a drier route. I wallowed perdu in mud and luxuriant
vegetation for about ten minutes, then, thinking all clear, crept
towards the charred ruin. I had actually got into the garden when I
heard a scuffle somewhere behind me. I fancy the police must have heard
it too, for there were footsteps on the gravel walk in front of the
house. Then came, from behind, a curious gurgling noise, then a dull
thud, then silence. A hand grasped my arm.

'"Come, sir," whispered a voice, and I felt myself dragged into a
clump of laurels. I was subtly aware that my present companion was a
friend, and I followed him without question. We crouched together for a
while, until the police, presumably supposing they had been deceived,
scrunched back into the road. He then put his lips to my ear.

'"I am Mr. Philipson's boy, sir," said he, in excellent English. "You
have some message for me?"

'"What is your name?" I asked him.

'"Lo Eng. You have a sign from my master?"

'I gave him the seal to feel, and I heard him murmur his satisfaction.
"Listen," he said, "Those devils set fire to the house a few hours
after the master went. I took the papers out of the safe, but
everything else was destroyed."

'"You are to give me the bundle marked with a letter B," I said.

'He took out a thick wad, and handed me an envelope from among them.
"Those are the ones," said he. "There is nothing else in the house,
for I have searched it. Please tell the _Lao Yeh_ I did everything
possible to protect his property, but they had lined the walls with
kerosene, and all went up very swiftly. Since then I have watched here
for my master. Those villains have also watched. One of them followed
you down this road to-night. I recognised him from the night of the
house-burning. I heard him tell you he was Mr. Philipson's boy. When
you ran, you thought you had left him behind, but you had not. He
followed you across the fields, so close that he could have killed you.
But I was just behind him."

'"Where is the fellow now?" I whispered.

'My ally drew me deeper into the shrubbery, where I kicked against
something soft. "He will not follow you any more," he said. "Help me to
cover him up, lest the police find him."'

At this point Lo Eng sat a little farther forward on the edge of his
chair, and broke in, with extreme deference.

'That man struggled very hard, master,' he said sweetly. 'I discovered
afterwards that I had strangled him.'

Philipson gravely nodded, and Poyning resumed his story.

'Lo Eng showed me a way across to the main traffic routes without
touching the New Highgate Road at all, and left me. I caught an inward
bound cabriolet to the city, cleared my own debit at the Eastern Seas
Hotel, collected my bag from the Marco Polo and settled up there, and
eventually reached the station with fifteen minutes to spare. I had
been zealously on the watch for followers all the way, and could have
pledged my faith that I had none; and yet, as I paced the platform, to
my supreme disgust I saw that two natives in the throng at least were
taking an abnormal amount of interest in my movements. They had been
over against a fruit stall in full view of the wicket I should have to
pass, but when they saw me, they edged unmistakably in my direction. I
walked up and down twice: they moved _pari passu_. I realised that if
I boarded the Nanking train, even if they did not follow me I should
have given away the route you had followed--always supposing these men
had connected me with you, which seemed tolerably plain. Then a device
occurred to me. There was a local train standing in the station. It was
due to leave for Wusung at ten-fifty. I regarded this as proof that
the gods were on my side. I went to the booking office and bought a
ticket for Wusung, intending to board that train, walk straight through
it, and gain my own by way of the track, trusting to providence and a
villainously illuminated station; but my two rascals were too quick for
me. I saw them get into a compartment about four distant from mine. The
situation, gentlemen, was growing strained, and I had already decided
not to travel at all that night, but to slink back into the city and
try again later, when yet another subterfuge came to my mind. I knew
that I could not leave that train without detection--at any rate so
long as it stood in the station. But if I waited until it started, and
then jumped, I might yet outwit the enemy. This course I followed,
though without the smooth success I had hoped. I waited too long before
jumping, and came the very disastrous cropper which resulted in this
bloody cockscomb you have been good enough to patch for me; and even
at that sacrifice I did not elude my two ruffians. As I fell I had a
blurred consciousness of other bodies falling from the train, and I
know that they fell with more agility than I did, for they were up and
upon me in an instant. I began to lay about me, but not dangerously,
for my head was swimming and I had frankly given up hope of getting out
of the imbroglio alive, when I realised that there was more in it than
at first appeared. There were three mirky shapes on that mirky railway
track--we were over a hundred yards out of the station--but one of
them was fighting on my side. I plucked up heart, and gave one of the
roughs such a taste of the fighting blood of the Poynings that he fell
backwards across the metals, struck his head, and lay still. The other
appeared to have had the worst of it with my ally, and the next thing I
knew, I had grabbed the suitcase and was bundling back along the track
with Lo Eng--to whose battling abilities throughout I would take this
occasion to bear the very warmest testimony. You'd better ask him what
happened after, for the world was waltzing around me again, and my
recollection becomes valueless as evidence.'

Lo Eng waited for a sign from Philipson, then delivered himself to this
effect:

'I feared that Mr. Poyning would be followed back into Shanghai, so
I followed him myself, all the way to the station. There it was as I
feared. I do not know how those men knew he was the gentleman they were
looking for, but they did know. I could see that he knew he was being
observed by them too. They were so intent on Mr. Poyning that they did
not see me get into the next carriage of the Wusung train. When they
jumped out, I jumped also. Then we fought, as Mr. Poyning has said, and
left those two men on the rails and ran back to the Nanking train. It
was just moving. He was so injured that he could not get up from the
ground, so I climbed into the train with the suit case and pulled him
up behind me. It was very difficult to do, and by the time we were on
board, the train was moving too fast for me to get off again. I had no
ticket, but Mr. Poyning paid my fare to the conductor. Then I bound
his head, which was bleeding, and he fell asleep until we reached here
this morning. We have not been followed since.'

Philipson rose from his chair and patted the servant's shaven head.
'You have done well, Lo Eng,' he said. 'You are a boy to be proud of.'

The expression of dog-like fidelity on the man's face deepened. 'Master
is going up country?' he said.

'Such is the case, Lo Eng,' replied Philipson, his eye twinkling.

The boy looked down at his demurely folded hands. 'There is no house in
Shanghai for me to guard now,' he murmured. 'The car was destroyed too.'

'Eh? That's the way the wind blows, is it? Very well, we shall be glad
of such a trusty servant, I have no doubt. You will go down and stay on
board the launch with Ah Sing now, and wait for orders.'

As soon as Lo Eng was out of the room, Philipson took Poyning's hand
and shook it. 'I am eternally beholden to you, Poyning,' he said
warmly. 'You have handled this business not only with discretion but
with a most commendable quantity of pluck. You had better lie down now
till breakfast is ready. After that, we will go into the future.'

'Well,' said Philipson to me, when we were alone, 'what think you?
Should we take the youth into partnership?'

'Seems to me,' I said, 'the question is, will he take us?'

Philipson had unlocked the suit case by the key Poyning left with him,
and was unwrapping the instruments from several yards of cotton wool.
Both came out quite undamaged.

'I am inclined to think,' said Saunders Philipson deliberatively, 'that
that _is_ the more correct way to put it.'




                              CHAPTER VI

             HOW WE JOURNEYED TO THE OBSCURE TOWN OF KIAI


When Poyning came in to breakfast, much renovated, we sat down to one
of the jolliest meals I ever remember. Philipson steered clear of
the subject of our forthcoming journey yet, but kept up a brisk fire
of yarns of his former experiences in the East; and I for one had to
admit that if I flattered myself I knew something about the great
yellow lands from Ladakh on the roof of the world to Kamchatka of the
frozen north, my knowledge was mere schoolboy geography to Saunders
Philipson's. Then we pushed away our plates and lit up, and Philipson
plunged into the business ahead of us, laying the whole story before
Poyning exactly as I had heard it myself. The junior partner listened
with the sort of negligent alertness he had shown when taking his
orders for the Shanghai commission, but I could see, underneath this,
that the story excited him a good deal more than it had me.

'Well, there you are, Poyning,' concluded our leader, 'You know all
the ascertained facts now. It will be a dangerous, death-or-glory
business--but at least a profitable one, if my suspicions are well
founded.'

The boy shrugged his shoulders. 'Diamonds would be an agreeable
incidental, certainly,' he said, 'but I should be perfectly ready to
risk my life going to that valley if there were no mention of gems in
the legend at all.'

Poyning said this in such a serious and decided tone that you might
almost have fancied he meant more than he said.

'Then you're with us?' queried Philipson.

'I am,' said Stephen Poyning firmly.

We shook hands on the bargain and swore, all three of us, to tear the
mystery out of that shadowy land behind the mountains or add our names
to the long list of explorers who have died of curiosity.

The day was spent in a lively bustle of preparation. If Philipson
was upset over the destruction of thousands of pounds' worth of his
property in Shanghai, he gave precious small sign of his chagrin; on
the contrary, he seemed to look on that business as a useful warning
not to underestimate the vigour and vindictiveness of our enemies. As
for the bi-lingual Lo Eng, he proved himself a pearl of price. All
that day he was in and out of the city buying stores, thus enabling
the rest of us to lie doggo--no small boon to folk in our case. Backed
by Philipson's deep purse he procured food, petrol, and ammunition
with despatch and discretion--so much so that I don't think even the
hawk-eyed customs officers, always watchful for the gun-runner and
opium-smuggler and similar law-breakers, ever knew of our stay in the
port. But to make sure of secrecy, when the time came to leave we
stole out of our creek propelled by the pair of small oars the launch
carried; and I've no doubt that in the fickle light before moonrise we
passed easily enough for one of the innumerable native boats thronging
the mouth of the inlet and the margins of Yangtze River itself.

We rowed well out into the stream, turned our nose westward, and
proceeded on a throttled engine until we had left Nanking a mile or
two over our quarter. Then began our long tussle with the down-rolling
might of Yangtze Kiang. Philipson made for the north bank, where,
thanks to our shallow draught, we could hug the shore even closer
than the interminable string of native junks, which, like ourselves,
were there to avoid the full strength of the current. These craft we
overhauled by the hundred, and now and then passed the lights of a
river steamer out in midstream going three miles to her two. Philipson
kept the tiller, Poyning and I sat down in the well, while Ah Sing
tended the engine and Lo Eng, in the cabin, got ready the beds against
such time as we should turn in. My last recollections before dropping
off in my bunk were the lady-like snores of Poyning as he lay tucked up
opposite me, and the chuckle of the wine which Philipson--tiller in one
hand and drinking outfit close by the other--poured out for himself. He
hadn't forgotten this among the preparations for departure--I think,
indeed, that before squaring up with mine hostess of Nanking, Saunders
Philipson bought the remainder of her cellar in a lot.

Poyning being a casualty, he was to stand no watch that night, and
the rest of us arranged the spells so that of Philipson and Ah Sing,
our best navigators, always one was at the helm. I completed my first
trick with the latter at four o'clock. It wasn't yet dawn, but there
had already sprung out of the east a wide fawn-coloured wash which
battled with the light of the setting moon. On our starboard bow
stretched untold miles of flat rice-land, broken here and there by
trees that seemed to rise straight from the silver bosom of the flood.
Great sailing junks, with their steep poops and huge chocolate lugsails
and three masts raking like the ribs of a fan, loomed vague and dark
against the neutral tints of the river. Then, in a wink, the moon
whitened, there was a glory of brightness over the mighty expanse of
water in our wake; and where one instant before all had been veiled in
a gossamer grey mist, now everything took on sudden startling tinges of
orange, opal, and pink. The greenery of the river bank became a golden
green, the vast flood flared up into bright mustard, and hull and mast
and sail of the native shipping sharpened into clean-cut blotches of
Vandyke brown. Wisps of smoke rose from the poop braziers of these
craft as the blue-cottoned junkmen cooked their breakfast, and now and
again a shrill chanty came to us across the water as they put out the
long bow-sweep and pulled upon it three and four abreast.

Philipson was in rare spirits when he came aft to relieve me. I stayed
with him a few minutes while he picked up his landmarks and reckoned
the amount of westing we had made in the night.

'Seventy miles if it is an inch,' said Saunders Philipson. 'The best
she has ever done.'

'Where d'you expect to fetch to-day?'

'Kiukiang, bar hitches. By about dusk. And Hankow the same time
to-morrow. It could not fall out better. All serene, Mirlees. Get your
sleep, for we shall want that cabin to feed in before long.'

The day passed without event, and so close to our leader's schedule
that we might have been a passenger service. Hour after hour we forged
ahead, the engine running smoothly and tirelessly as the wings of
the great gulls over our heads, and a little before nightfall we had
drawn within view of the hills that reach away south of Kiukiang. Here
we tied up in an inlet at one end of the bund, and slept on board,
creeping out again before the break of day, and pushing on up stream
till dusk.

At last, two ranks of light like the lamps of a long street began to
blink out of the grey shadows ahead, and we came into a great expanse
of water swarming with craft of every conceivable build, from liner and
ocean-going tramp down to the lorchas and wupans and crazy houseboats
of the amphibious population of these parts. To the right of us lay
Hankow, with its long bund and its hulks running out into the river
and its opulent business houses behind; on the southern bank, the
battlemented, sombre city of Wuchang.

We drew opposite a small native wharf on the south side, then turned
and ran straight in.

'Luckily,' said Philipson to me, 'I have good and discreet friends
hereabouts. Otherwise it would be awkward. The boat will have to go up
on the slips.'

I gave him a look of surprise.

'Put your hand down here,' said Philipson quietly.

He had stooped into the well and lifted out a small bit of
bottom-boarding. I felt below it, and drew up my hand wet to the wrist.
There were four or five inches of water inboard of us.

'It is obviously small,' he muttered, 'but we must overhaul the boat
before we go on. It will never do to try the rapids higher up with a
gap in our strakes.'

The yard we had come to was capitally suited to our ends, being shut
in on all sides except for a narrow water frontage; and even that was
still further secluded by two timber partitions running out like the
walls of a fives-court. The place, moreover, afforded easy and secret
access to a native inn outside the city wall, where Philipson told us
we were to spend the night. The proprietor of the yard had clearly had
truck with Philipson before, since he greeted him with marked respect
and more than a shade of fear.

'The good Charon seems to know you, Philipson,' said Poyning, as we
stood together on the jetty, while three coolies hauled the launch out
of the water with a small capstan of native pattern.

'He does,' replied our leader. 'I had the good fortune to save him
from the headsman some years ago, under circumstances that will not
bear repeating. He has shown his gratitude by helping me several times
since. Now, to business. You two can be of no use to me here. You had
better get along with Lo Eng to our quarters for the night. He will
give you a meal, but do not wait for me. I shall possibly be late.'

Philipson was. We had finished our meal and smoked many pipes before he
arrived, a little after midnight.

'Rather worse than I thought,' he said, setting ravenously about a cold
chicken and a bottle of hock.

'What's wrong with her?'

'A leak just under the forefoot. We must have started a plank when we
struck the other boat in Whangpu River, and gradually opened it out
while we drove up stream. There is a good deal of sunken driftwood in
the river at most times--I expect you heard her bump against it?'

'Time and again, but never very hard.'

'Exactly. It would not hurt a sound boat, but with the strake already
loose it is only a matter of keeping on long enough to develop a nasty
hole. Luckily we spotted it in time.'

'All right now?'

'I fancy so; but it is impossible to say, working with their wretched
lamps. I must go over her thoroughly by daylight. Better turn in now,
Mirlees, as I shall want you at dawn. It becomes necessary for me to
cross to the Hankow side, on business which I shall certainly get
through more safely in native garb. Also I should be glad of a reliable
companion in case of accidents, and as a European and a Chinese moving
about together are likely to attract a degree of notice we can very
well do without, I shall be glad if you will don that Chinese costume
which suits you so well. Poyning will meanwhile keep to this side and
watch out of window for any suspicious boat on the river.'

He rose from the table, threw off his clothes, wrapped himself in a
long cotton gown, and was at once asleep on the couch in his corner
of the room. Poyning and I--we were all three sleeping in the one
chamber--had soon followed suit. There was a deal of noise in and
about the inn, but I don't think we heard much of it: certainly I
did not. It seemed to me I had only just lain down when I was shaken
by the shoulder, and saw Philipson standing by my bed, fully dressed
in the rig in which I had first seen him. I hastily made up to match
from a bundle Lo Eng had brought from the launch, and after swallowing
biscuits and a cup of wine we went down into the yard together. Here I
got something of a shock. Our launch was gone, and another had taken
her place.

Philipson squeezed my arm. 'We had to paint the new plank we put in
last night,' he whispered, 'and I thought it would be advisable to do
the rest of the hull while we were at it--in another colour. Those
dummy wash-streaks forward, too, they transform her considerably, do
they not? If there is a description of us about, it may be as well not
to answer to it. Hullo, here is our boat. Not another word of English
now till we are alone again!'

We entered the sampan he had engaged, and were sculled out across the
two miles of stream through a wonderful morning, fine and clear, with
a fresh easterly breeze. Even as early as this there was a loud hum of
activity abroad; the daily round of the great river port had already
begun, and the bustle was still further increased by the arrival of a
river steamer which had drawn up to her hulk just as we pushed in to
the north bank. We saw the gangplanks swing down and a throng of native
passengers surge across them. Philipson had been scanning the crowd,
but he suddenly dropped his eyes to the bottom of the boat and muttered
an order to the boatman. We turned up stream, taking advantage of any
and every craft that lay there or passed, to keep ourselves hidden from
the shore, and at last reached a jetty about a quarter of a mile from
the point where we had originally purposed landing. Here my companion
ordered the sampan to wait, and we sprang ashore and straight into two
native "chairs"--capital conveyances for a furtive mission, since they
were completely closed in--and were borne into the dense warrens of the
native city of Hankow by a twisting route that soon robbed me of all
sense of direction. I felt my chair set down, and stepping out found we
were in a squalid courtyard walled in on three sides by native houses.
Philipson took my arm and led me through a low doorway in one of the
walls, thence along a narrow winding alley, from the end of which we
ascended a flight of rickety wooden stairs. There was a door at the
head of these, upon which Philipson knocked softly, and I noticed that
the signal he gave was his own peculiar five taps. A house boy came, to
whom my companion muttered something in the vernacular which I couldn't
catch; then the servant took us through a bare ante room, and withdrew
deeper into this queer, secret dive.

Philipson put his mouth to my ear. 'Treat this man with the profoundest
respect,' he whispered. 'He possesses ideas that would do credit to any
European revolutionary. The Manchu Dynasty have had a price upon his
head for years.'

The door opened, and a small wizened Chinaman appeared in the aperture.
Taking cue from Philipson I bowed low to him, and we exchanged
compliments in the official dialect of Peking, which he spoke with a
musical perfection. He drew my companion through into the inner room,
closing the door behind them; and there I heard the pair in an agitated
mutter of conversation for the best part of twenty minutes. Whatever
it was Philipson wanted, he had apparently prevailed upon the rat-like
little fellow to give him, for when he came out he was carrying under
his arm something wrapped in cloth, angular, the size of a largish
attach√© case, and apparently heavy. We took an elaborate ceremonial
leave, got downstairs and regained our chairs, and within half an
hour were harking back across the river, again taking advantage of
every floating thing that could screen us from the bank. Ah Sing was
standing watch at the yard when we arrived, peeping through the holes
in a curtain of old tarpaulins he had rigged up. Philipson ordered me
to join Poyning in the inn and get breakfast while he overhauled the
launch, promising to follow as soon as he had finished.

We were still at the meal when Philipson came in.

'All's well,' he cried cheerfully. 'She is tight now--tighter, in fact,
than she was before!'

Poyning didn't appear to share the exultation of our chief. He was
rolling his eye round the bare room of the inn with an expression of
boredom. 'A simple, homely interior,' he said 'but already I find its
charm beginning to pall. When do we tempt the deep again, Philipson?'

'Dusk to-night,' replied the leader briskly. 'I had not intended to
leave this place by daylight in any case, less still now that I know
our enemies have reached Hankow.'

'You've seen them?'

'I have; and they may have seen me, though Mirlees will tell you that
I did my best to avoid this by sheering off on another tack. It is
possible, Poyning, that you do not yet fully realise the determination
of that company. They are not to be put off by temporary setbacks.
After your brush with two of their number on the permanent way in
Shanghai it was only a matter of time for them to track us to Nanking,
and from Nanking here. Moreover, it now becomes more than a question
of stealing my papers and my secret. Every victory we have gained will
only aggravate their hostility. The agents detailed to destroy us
will fail to do so at peril of their own lives from the organisation
behind them, and they will leave no chance neglected. They will ransack
this neighbourhood for us; their sentry may be watching our yard with
a glass at this moment--in which case he will not see much. But if
we move out in daylight, our boat is bound to be observed, and will
certainly be followed. If, on the other hand, we succeed in getting
away from here unobserved, we are now coming to parts of the river
where it will be more and more difficult for them to follow, or to get
warnings on ahead of us by telegraph. I am convinced that the delay
will be worth while in the long run.'

We accordingly sat down to wait, not even venturing outside our room,
while Ah Sing kept to his spying post in the yard. Never have I known a
day drag so; it would be hard to say which of us was most relieved when
night fell, and we could throw down the canvas screen from the launch
and heave her down into the water.

We slunk darkly away up stream. If there were watchers, we seemed to
have eluded them. By nine o'clock the long lights of Hankow were fading
in our wake, and by half-past we had come to a reach strangely deserted
and silent after the bustle of the great hub of Chinese riverine
traffic. We drove ahead at full speed, Philipson steering.

Suddenly he pricked up his ears. 'What's that?' he cried.

We all sat listening. I heard nothing, but about a minute later there
came, carried far across the still water, a distinct gunshot, and
another after about the same interval.

'Odd!' muttered Philipson. 'If we were at sea you might say somebody
was trying to make distress signals.'

Poyning had stood up, and was peering over the edge of the wash-streaks
forward. 'There's a curious light in the river straight ahead,' he
cried. 'Great Scott, it's a boat on fire!'

We all looked now, and there, sure enough, was a big sailing junk
drifting down upon us, broadside on and plainly out of control. Dense
smoke bellied from her midships, and by the tongues of flame that
licked up through it we caught momentary flashlight glimpses of her
crew crowding into stem and stern in a panic to get away from the heat.
They kept up the minute guns till we were within hail, then raised a
chorus of piteous yells.

It was a dilemma. Our own safety rested upon secrecy and speed, and we
were in no sort of position to stop for crews of shipwrecked natives.
At the same time, to leave them unhelped would be to give them the
alternative of a horrible death by fire or the very slim chance of
swimming ashore across a mile of strong current either way. We could
see no sign of a smaller boat--apparently the junk hadn't one.

Philipson stood staring at the lurid picture. 'Nothing for it,' he said
suddenly. 'Yellow or white, it is all human life. I will take them off,
and put ashore at the first opportunity.'

Poyning had run forward and was kneeling behind the dummy wash-streaks,
boathook in hand. The next instant he had dropped flat to the deck.

'Down, everybody!' he yelled. 'That fire's a fake!'

Three or four shots crashed out, and Lo Eng slid into the well with a
short gasping cough. We had all ducked at Poyning's cry, and Philipson
put the tiller hard down, but too late. The way on the launch took us
right alongside before she could be turned, and two figures leapt up
rifle in hand from behind the junk's house and dashed for us, firing
as they ran. Poyning sprang to meet the first, grappled, and thudded
with him down on to the deck; the other came on, took these two in his
stride like a hurdler, and rushed aft for our engine. For an instant
I saw the fellow outlined against the fire on the junk. Then came a
deafening report, something scorched my cheek, and I felt a sting like
an exaggerated pinprick in my shoulder. I fell forward, but in the very
act of falling I instinctively clutched at his knees as he stood on the
cabin roof, and heaved with the last ounce of strength left in me. I
think the fellow must have gone overboard, but I don't rightly know.
Everything round me became a spongy grey mist. The flashes and reports
mingled in a sort of wild, hell-begotten dream. I must have fainted
then, for when I next remember, there was a marked change in the aspect
of the fight. I myself lay sprawling across the cabin roof--apparently
just as I had collapsed. When I lifted my head I realised that we were
backing away from the junk and that somebody in our bows was crouching
behind a thing that spat fire with a stuttering roar. I saw the great
mainmast of the junk totter and fall, dashing the remains of the fire
into the water with a smoky hiss, and heard, or thought I heard, a
shrill scream of agony and terror from many throats. I rested on my
elbows, staring stupidly, while the flame from our bows played over the
junk like a hose; then I must have lost my senses for a second time....

When I came to, I was lying on a locker in the cabin, while Philipson
leaned over me and dabbed something cool on my bare shoulder, which was
aching and stinging abominably.

'A nasty jag, Mirlees,' he said as he dressed the wound. 'That bullet
was in two minds whether to expand or not. Luckily it has left the
bones alone.'

'Who else is hurt?' I queried. 'I saw Lo Eng go down.'

'He has a hole through the apex of his right lung. Nothing desperate,
but he will require careful nursing.'

'And you? What's that on your wrist?'

'A mere graze. But the same shot punched a piece out of the tiller,
which I must fish without loss of time, or we shall be having a snap in
a crisis.'

Philipson continued at work all the time he was talking, swiftly
and skilfully. Where he picked up his knowledge of surgery I don't
know, but I fancy it would have been equal to the emergencies of a
battlefield. He was just completing a sling for my arm when Poyning's
face, the natural freckles supplemented by a liberal sprinkling of
powder-flecks, appeared through the cabin door.

'Come and watch the casualties, Poyning,' said our leader. 'I will
relieve you as soon as I have patched the steering-gear.'

Poyning took his place beside me, and squatted in silence, mopping his
face with a handkerchief. On the opposite locker Lo Eng was asleep,
breathing peacefully.

'Philipson tackled him while you were aswoon,' said Poyning at length,
nodding to the boy, 'and gave him a cooling mixture which put him
off at once. The managing director's bedside manner is distinctly
attractive to watch, Mirlees, I assure you.'

'You're not hurt?'

'I'm tattooed blue with powder-spirts like any Polynesian, but
Philipson hopes it will wash out in after years. Beyond that I am
suffering from slight muscular strain and grave loss of self-respect.
I fought to-night as no gentleman fights. I--er, bit my antagonist.
His gun fell overboard in the course of our struggles, and shortly
afterward he fell overboard after it.'

'Tell me what happened,' I said. 'It seems I went green right in the
middle of it.'

'My own recollection is none too clear,' replied Poyning. 'One of the
boarding party got past me, and I heard him fire. That, apparently, is
when you were hit. It was just at this point that I rolled my opponent
into the water. I heard another splash after that. Then Philipson
yelled to me to come and take the tiller. He had reversed the engine,
and we were drawing away. Philipson ran forward and began, as it seemed
to me, to pull the launch to pieces. Something came up with a clank,
and before you could say knife or any other abrupt monosyllable he had
entered upon a new campaign with--ye gods!--a maxim gun. It was one
of the pleasantest surprises of my life to learn that we had such an
armament on board.'

I heard Philipson chuckle in the doorway.

'I was unaware of it myself till yesterday,' he said, stooping to
enter. 'I could never understand why this boat was a little down by the
head, but when we took out that damaged plank, I saw quickly enough.
There is a false bulkhead forward of the cabin, and behind that a
machine gun mounted on a vertical slide built into the hull. When you
take away the deck planking above it the thing can be raised to fire
over the bows. I give you my word, the whole contrivance is highly
ingenious. When I discovered that we had such a treasure I at once set
about getting it in working order. That is what kept me so late in the
yard last night. The bearing parts were somewhat rusty, but they worked
again with persuasion and grease. All that then remained was to find
ammunition--a problem which at first seemed formidable enough. But
there again my incomparable luck was with me. I have had a good deal
to do with revolutionary activities in this country at one time and
another, for the subject is one which interests me. I happened to know
that one of my former acquaintances, to whom I had been of service,
was now skulking in Hankow, awaiting the next chance to gratify his
life-long ambition of overthrowing the Manchu Dynasty. That man's
vocation as a rebel conspirator obliges him to deal in such things as
maxims and ammunition for the same, and if there were any contraband
stocks in Hankow, he would know where they were. At any rate, now that
I had found the gun, the opportunity to secure some was too good to be
missed, and was worth even taking a certain risk for. Things turned
out better than I had hoped. He had ammunition in his own den, and on
my paying a liberal contribution to the "cause" he brought himself to
part with two belts--though in point of fact I imagine he anticipated
his quarters were to be raided in the near future and was rather glad
to get rid of the damning evidence. I knew well enough without taking
measurements that the ammunition would fit our gun.'

'How did you know that?'

'I had a strong suspicion that both came into this country in the same
gun-running. The venerable desperado we visited in Hankow, Mirlees,
was the man from whom I purchased this boat. That was in Canton two
years ago. He had in hand at the time as pretty a little armed rising
as you could wish to see. Unfortunately the plot was discovered at the
last moment, and my friend was obliged to leave in such haste that he
could not even get to his own private launch. So he did the next best
thing--sold her to me. He was much surprised to see me this morning,
but even more so when I told him I had discovered the hidden gun. At
first he wished to buy the launch back. I said that I could not spare
it. He pressed his point. I hinted with all possible delicacy that
if he were so importunate the imperial authorities might get to hear
of his whereabouts. At last he made the best of it, sold me two belts
of ammunition at an exorbitant price, and I took it across the stream
and installed it in our bows. I think you will admit that measure of
precaution was well justified by the event.'

'And may be again,' said Poyning. 'Is there any ammunition left?'

'One belt, but I do not anticipate needing it. Something seems to tell
me that we have seen the last of our enemies for a season. There will
at least be no survivors from this affair to report where we are. Those
junks are very heavy, and they sink quickly when they are wounded
below the waterline. I cut a plank out of that one. I can forgive most
things, but not treachery.'

'It was a pretty cute idea,' I said, 'the junk in distress.'

'Brilliant,' he agreed, heartily. 'They must have guessed we should be
upstream from Hankow before long. No doubt they had been hanging about
here at anchor, and started their dummy fire as soon as they heard our
engine. Without a fast boat of their own--their launch, I fancy, is
still far down the river--it was about the best ruse they could have
chosen for coming to grips with us on the water. With ordinary luck
they must have succeeded.'

My wound healed quickly, and on the third day after the fight I was
able to move about in fair comfort. We had now come to the stiffest
spell of our river journey--the ascent of the beautiful but perilous
Yangtze Gorges. These famous localities are too well known from books
of travel to need expatiating on here. Suffice it to say that we had
passed in a few hours from reedy flats and swamps into a region of
tremendous limestone cliffs, sometimes rising naked into the sky like a
rock wall built by the Titans, sometimes cleft most picturesquely with
gullies of pine and bamboo and orange-trees or bearded with clematis
and fern. Not that we had much opportunity to admire the scenery. Our
whole attention was usually concentrated upon getting that launch
safely past dangerous whirlpools and snag-bottomed shallows into the
comparatively peaceful water beyond. Philipson had well chosen his time
for the attempt. The annual rise of the river, while it had already
deepened the worst shoals, had not yet come to the tremendous pitch
it reaches in autumn, when the mere force and volume of the water
crushed into these jaws a few hundred yards wide blocks all progress
for a span of months. As it was, our ascent was a wild, touch-and-go
affair throughout, and I hardly knew whether to marvel more at the
capabilities of our boat or the consummate nerve and skill of Saunders
Philipson in handling her. There was the usual assembly of junks at
the foot of each gorge, waiting their turn to be "tracked"--which is
to say, hauled up through the racing water by big gangs of coolies
harnessed to bamboo ropes ashore; and as we came along and set about
ascending on our own motor power, tremendous yells went up from the
trackers and the crews of the waiting junks and the sailors of the
red-hulled lifeboats. These outcries may have been a warning to us,
but I think rather that to the eyes of these primitive, superstitious
folk we appeared a devil-boat, a phantom living through water that
would have destroyed any craft of this world.

One after another we took the dreaded gullies between the
mountains--Niukan, Mitan, Wushan, the Wind-Box Gorge and the "Old
Horse"; and when finally we reached Chungking, nine days after leaving
the plains, I imagine we had accomplished a feat never before known in
the history of Yangtze Kiang. Here Philipson had the launch thoroughly
overhauled and put into store. Often during the next few weeks as we
crawled up the rapid-fretted Kia Ling River, a tributary of Yangtze,
in a native boat, we pined for that queenly little craft we had left
behind. It was impracticable to take her farther, however, for here at
Chungking, our last halting place with any pretensions to civilisation,
we were obliged to lay in most of the stores for our cross-continental
march--tents, blankets, water-proofs, cooking gear and what all; and
this left precious little room to spare even in the big junk we now
chartered.

You shall lose sight of us during this tedious and uneventful last lap
up stream. It is enough to say that we appeared to have shaken off
finally the gang which had pursued us with such dogged hatred--it may
be they continued their search up the main stream of Yangtze River--and
that by the middle of June we had come to the small obscure town of
Kiai, where we engaged ponies and grooms and now, a party ten strong,
struck out westward across "unknown" Asia.




                              CHAPTER VII

                      STORM AND PERIL AND STRESS


We began our land journey in high spirits. Whatever perils nature might
be holding up her sleeve, our human enemies were left far behind; and
it wasn't till now that I realised fully the racking strain of suspense
we had undergone since we fled for our lives out of Shanghai. Good was
it, too, as we advanced in file, to look back over our shoulders at the
sturdy bearers and the wiry hill-ponies that carried the outfit for
our expedition. But most satisfactory of all was the thought that we
were travelling with Saunders Philipson. Poyning and I had now reached
the pitch of confidence when a man believes in his leader's ultimate
success as a certainty. The Chinese servants had known Philipson longer
than we, and their trust in him seemed by that much the more implicit.
Even the native bearers, after a few days of the master who seemed
to know their wants so well and speak their language so fluently and
pick out their small shirkings with such intimate comprehension, were
beginning to fall under the magic of his radiant personality.

The third night out, we pitched camp and dined in the nearest approach
to elegance we were to know for many a long day. Lo Eng excelled
himself in the kitchen--we hadn't yet reached the period of canned
foods--and Philipson produced three bottles of red wine which he called
upon us to help him empty.

'Let us clean it up,' he cried. 'We cannot count on re-stocking the
bins for many months--which will fall upon me, at least, with grave
hardship--but it will be merely teasing ourselves to make these bottles
spin out for a day or two. Besides which, corked wine is never nice.
Come, let us pledge success to our journey in a good deep pull!'

It sticks in my mind very clear, that scene round the camp fire.
Behind us rose great hills of red rock, now deepened by the failing
light to a crimson as dark as the wine of our toast, and sweeping away
in majestic ranks on either side of the pass through which we should
work westward. The natives were squatting round their fire a little
way off, cooking their evening meal and, I'm afraid, burning slips of
joss-paper to scare off evil spirits of the hills; while the ponies,
picketed at some distance beyond the bearers, were pulling contentedly
at the scant grass of the highlands. Beside the tarpaulin that served
us for tablecloth, Poyning, with a quaint hint of dandyism in his
rough mountaineering rig, sat puffing at one of his carefully hoarded
cigarettes through a dapper little ivory and amber holder. At this time
he still possessed his eyeglass, though I fancy it subsequently went
the way of so much more gear that we scattered along that desperate
trail. Philipson, who never smoked except to sustain some native
guise, was leaning forward, the light of the fire leaping over his
clean-chiselled features; and as he laid down his aluminium wine cup
after pledging a swift and successful trek to us all, he began to speak.

'Listen to me, you fellows,' he said earnestly. 'This is going to be
the biggest adventure any man here has ever undertaken. It will also be
the most dangerous. The journey to the _obo_ alone is severe enough,
and what lies beyond that, God knows, though from what I remember of
the look of the mountains it will be far more difficult than anything
this side. But if you follow me heart and soul, I believe I can lead
you over to the valley beyond. Trust me as you would trust the eternal
truths of life, and I shall not fail you. I know I can carry it
through!'

His voice rang, his eyes gleamed, his hands clutched and unclutched,
and altogether Saunders Philipson looked like a man inspired--which,
for my part, I fully believe he was.

A moment later he was pouring out the last of the claret with a calm
judicial air. 'Do not be alarmed if I have my dramatic moods,' he said.
'I should not speak as I do unless I felt the truth of every word
I say. Now you had better turn in, for I am going to work you hard
to-morrow. Let me give you this advice at the starting out: never be
afraid of a long march. My experience of these mountains tells me that
the man who gets through is he who makes a dash for it. It is like a
bayonet charge over open country--the quicker you cross, the safer.'

We made the long stage he foretold, and several longer after that.
Hour upon hour, hour upon hour we rode up precipitous gullies and
down seemingly impossible ravines, but always drew higher in the long
run. The mere exertion of sitting our ponies was tremendous. I soon
came to realise that never before, in a life that would be reckoned
abnormally strenuous, had I really known what fatigue meant, and
Poyning was worse off than I; but weariness never seemed to show itself
on Philipson. At the first sign of flagging anywhere, he was to hand,
helping or exhorting or bullying as the case appeared to him to demand,
and getting us on the move again when you would have said flesh and
blood could endure no more. His genius for organisation was no whit
inferior to his energy, and his sense of country more astonishing than
either. Time and again, when we had come to a sheer blind alley in the
mountains and were at the end of our strength, Philipson divined a way
out, found the necessary pass himself by searching on foot, and brought
us safe over. The distances we travelled in a day were incredible. On
one occasion we must have covered forty-five miles between sunrise and
sundown, and that over some of the roughest and steepest country we had
yet struck. Before the end of this stage Poyning was in a collapse,
so weary that he could no longer keep his saddle; whereupon Philipson
dismounted and walked beside him, holding the boy up, and for the last
mile more than half carrying him in his arms. Yet I noticed it was
Saunders Philipson who did most of the work in camp that night--the
bearers themselves were dead beat--and that Philipson was first up in
the morning, field glass in hand, scouring the mountainside for the
easiest route. I couldn't help reflecting what a magnificent leader in
war this man would have made. Good troops would have followed him to
the very ends of the earth.

I soon saw, too, the wisdom of his policy of taking mountain ranges at
a run, for here we were, with the summer still before us, and the first
great barrier range behind. The country began to descend, the going was
easier and faster, and after a few days' march down a long slant we
came within view of our first big landmark. I heard the bearers raise
a shout and saw them throw out their arms, pointing. There, still far
ahead, was a curious bluey shimmer on the rough yellow face of the
earth. Philipson was scanning this through the glasses.

'What do you make of it, Mirlees?' he cried.

'It ought to be the head waters of the Yellow River,' I replied.

'Right. Or rather, the upper waters. The actual sources are about seven
days farther on. When we reach them I can promise you a breather of
three whole days.'

All fell out as he foretold. We encamped beside the Hsing Hai, or
"Starry Lakes," which, rising out of springs in the plain, form the
beginnings of that mighty flood known many hundreds of miles farther
east as China's Sorrow. Plain the country is called by courtesy only,
for it stands at a level higher than the highest peaks of Great
Britain, and can be conceived as a plain only by contrast with the
great mountain ranges to north and south. Here we rested three days.
To me, at least, the time was one of delight; it had long been my
ambition to explore the source of the most lawless river in the world;
my notebook was almost a fixture on my knee, and I reflected that if
the expedition brought nothing else, it would at any rate enable me to
offer the geographers a few hard facts in place of the mess of theory
and surmise-at-a-distance that makes up our knowledge of this region.

Poyning spent most of the three days asleep, while Philipson was busy
with Lo Eng overhauling stores and looking for fresh bearers. The men
of Kiai had only contracted to come this far, but partly by enhanced
rewards and partly by a judicious blend of threat and blandishment
Philipson prevailed on them to stay with us until relieved. The new
company, of ten men, we raised at length from a wretched hamlet on
the foothills southward of the lakes. They were _tagliks_ (hillmen)
of indeterminate race and small prepossession, and they hadn't been
with us long before they gave us ample reason to regret the sturdy
Ssuchuanese whose place they had taken.

At dawn on the fourth day we struck out westward again, at the best
pace we could make. Speed was vital, in fact, for we should soon be at
heights where the "hot" weather nights are arctic and winter allows
nothing human to live. It was Philipson's purpose to hold on this
course until we cut across the route of his former journey, then to
work by means of his maps to the _obo_ among the mountains. Before
we had travelled many days the country was rising sharply again, its
aspect changing from hour to hour. The scattered tamarisks of the
plateau were left far behind, now nothing grew to soften the staring
nakedness of red sandstone and green slate but here and there a patch
of wiry, bleached grass, out of which the ponies could get but a meagre
supplement to the limited fodder we carried. Now and again we sighted
the beautiful yellow-brown wild ass, sometimes the fleeting form of
some type of antelope, while at night we were glad of our camp fire not
only for its warmth, but also for the protection it gave us against
the wolves we heard howling hungrily around us. Gradually, however, as
we drew higher and higher, even these signs of life dropped out of the
vast desolation, and we saw nothing but an occasional herd of yak, the
wild bull of Tibet.

This creature is one of the riddles of the animal kingdom. While of a
size and strength and savagery that would enable him to hold his own in
a lion country, he yet elects for some unfathomed reason to herd far
up the steeps of these Tibetan mountain ranges, where no other animal
barring polar bears and arctic foxes could live to dispute with him the
stunted pasture I have already mentioned. He is coated with long wool
which sweeps the ground on either side of his magnificent trunk, and
lives through the coldest winter at an altitude where even the summer
nights bring with them a temperature well below zero Fahrenheit. I have
dwelt on the queer habits of the yak because it was in our encounter
with one of the species that Saunders Philipson showed himself in a
light that almost set me wondering whether he was mortal man like the
rest of us. It was more than amazing. It was uncanny.

Uncertain as we were whether our canned stuff would last out the trip,
we were constantly on the alert for a chance to supplement it with game
of the country; and when we sighted a fine herd of yak at feed plumb in
the middle of our path one day, we decided to halt the caravan and try
a shot. Yak beef, I may remark, is a good deal better than pony-steak,
and in those cold dry altitudes will keep indefinitely.

There was no cover within close range of the herd, nor was there need
of any: the yak continued to feed after observing us, as if totally
indifferent to our approach, and I make no doubt they had never seen
human beings before. I had loaded my .45 and was edging nearer, with
Philipson and Poyning on my heels.

'Careful aim, Mirlees,' whispered Philipson to me. 'Those brutes are
not usually dangerous till they are wounded. You know where to put your
shot?'

'Just behind the shoulder is best, isn't it?'

'The only place. As for the bony parts, you might as well loose off
into a concrete wall. Now is your chance.'

I picked out a magnificent bull standing broadside on to us, and fired
at about fifty yards. The beast threw up its head with a snort of
wrath, but didn't appear to be wounded dangerously, let alone mortally.
Philipson snatched the rifle from my hand, loaded and fired again, but
it was too late. The herd, ten or eleven in number, had seen where the
attack came from. They put down their heads and charged. I yelled to
the bearers for more rifles, but the bearers had dropped everything and
scattered, leaving the ponies to stampede in terror with all our gear.

There was nothing for it now but to stampede ourselves, which we did,
heading instinctively for the shelter of a great boulder at some
distance from the spot where I had fired. Poyning and I reached it
abreast, but as I glanced back over my shoulder I saw to my horror that
Philipson hadn't followed. He stood out in the open, rifle in hand,
loading and firing rapidly, it is true, but with no more precipitation
than if he had been at the butts.

'Good God!' yelled Poyning. 'The man will be trampled flat!'

In an instant he had wheeled and dashed back, waving his arms and
shouting, as if in a wild hope to stem that terrible charge. He
might as well have shouted at a typhoon of the China seas. Philipson
continued to fire. He must have got in three shots before the rush
drew near, and the main herd swerved and went wide; but the wounded
bull came on alone, bellowing with fury. He was within ten yards of
Philipson when a shot took him between the forelegs, and I could see
that at last he was checked. The great brute swung to the right,
straight at Poyning, who leapt aside but stumbled in the doing and fell
heavily to earth. The next instant he was on his back, helpless, while
the monster drew up and lowered the enormous horns to gore.

Then ensued the most amazing sight these eyes of mine have ever beheld.
In a flash Philipson had dropped his rifle and dived forward, gripping
the horns of the yak at their tips. I expected to see him instantly
tossed high in the air, but this didn't happen. The yak paused, as
if bewildered to find this weight drop suddenly from nowhere on to
its horns. Then it seemed to me that the beast _could not move_. It
pawed the earth restlessly with its hind hoofs, but the fore hoofs
remained quite still, as did the monstrous head. You would have said
some instantaneous catalepsy had turned the animal's forequarters to
stone. I stood still, gazing, spellbound by the sight, and there, for
a span of seconds that seemed hours, we were in a tableau: Poyning
motionless and apparently stunned, the huge yak held by the horns,
Philipson holding it, and staring between the brute's eyes with a look
of tremendous, overpowering concentration.

It was a movement of Poyning's that brought me to myself. He rolled
suddenly towards the rifle. I dashed in and snatched it up and had my
cartridge in the chamber, when the yak gave a queer sort of whistling
groan, swayed slowly to one side, and fell with a thud that made the
earth jump under our feet. I fired at the same instant, but I know
the brute was dead before my bullet struck. It lay still. Saunders
Philipson was lying beside it, white as the snow on the peaks above us,
a thin trickle of blood coming from his nostrils.

In an agony of alarm I dragged him aside and rested his head on my
sheepskin coat. I was afraid at first his tremendous effort had
ruptured some blood vessel and that he would be beyond the reach of my
rough-and-ready attentions there in the wilderness. Poyning had now got
his senses fully back, and together we felt Philipson's heart--which
was beating weak and slow--and chafed his wrists and plied him with
brandy from Poyning's flask; and after some time it seemed the life
was flickering up in him again. The blood had dried quickly on his
lip, and the faintest tinge of red was coming back into his face. In
my travels at one time and another I've seen a good deal of woundings
and miscellaneous injuries to the human frame, yet I couldn't put down
Philipson's unconsciousness to any definite physical hurt. Rather he
seemed to me to display the sort of symptoms you might expect from a
man in an absolute nervous prostration.

At last, to our unspeakable relief, he stirred, sat up, and stared
round him.

'Eh? Oh, yes, I remember,' he muttered. 'The yak-herd.'

Poyning was on his knees beside him. 'Philipson,' he said hoarsely,
'you pulled me out of that at your own life's risk. I shall not forget
it. How do you feel now?'

Philipson was struggling to his feet. 'It is nothing,' he said quietly.
'You would have done as much for either of us. But we really must be
more careful in future. It was--' he glanced at the dead yak--'as much
as I could do to hold that beast.'

'Good God, man,' I cried, 'it was amazing! Six ordinary men couldn't
have held it!'

Philipson gave me a queer enigmatic smile. 'Be just, Mirlees,' he said.
'Give the yak his due. See here.' He stooped over the great beast and
pulled the clotted hair aside from its breast. 'If the brute had not
received this injury I am much afraid he would have thrown me half way
along the pass.'

'But your hands!' exclaimed Poyning, pointing to Philipson's bruised
and blackened fingers and the blood that had oozed out from under every
one of his ten nails. 'You must have put tremendous force into it! You
must have the muscles of a Hercules!'

Philipson's answer was to pull up his sleeves, revealing arms that
were muscular and shapely, but a good deal smaller than those of many
a professional athlete. 'If it were a question of muscle,' he said,
'even a badly hit yak would be too much for the hero you mention. But
the good gods have given us other powers. I used mine to-day. Let us be
thankful that I had them to use. Now for re-assembling the camp.'

We recovered the stampeded ponies, helped by Ah Sing and Lo Eng, who
had been far in the rear at the time of the brush, leading one of the
baggage animals that had gone lame and could carry no load. One by one
we got the lot, but the bearers were harder to collect. I noticed a
couple of them skulking shamefast in the middle distance, and thought
at first they were watching me; then I saw it was Philipson they were
looking at, with eyes of awe and fear. When at last they had gathered
into a sulky knot, Philipson summoned them to approach. They hesitated,
then, obviously in spite of themselves, slunk up to our leader, who
addressed them in their own dialect. I didn't know enough of this to
follow his words closely, but there was no mistaking the gist. The
hillmen were manifestly ill at ease. They shifted their weight from
one foot to the other. Under the swarthy skin and life-long dirt of
their faces a paleness became apparent. With a miserable cry one of
them dropped to his knees, head to earth, and the rest followed suit,
groaning and whining. Still the level, hard voice of Saunders Philipson
kept on. It was like some long, blighting curse to listen to. He
pointed to the yak, apparently drawing a parallel from its fate, and at
last strode up to the grovelling hillmen, stretching his blood-crusted
hands over their heads and raising his voice to a startling, terrible
shout. At this moment I happened to glance at Poyning. I may have been
mistaken, but I thought he trembled. Then I noticed I was trembling a
little myself.

Philipson ceased, motioning the bearers back to their work, and they
scuttled off, clearly relieved to find themselves still alive.

'Those fellows will behave better in future,' said our leader, turning
to us. 'They know now that the next man to fail in his duty dies. I
have also taken the precaution of making them understand that I am
bullet-proof, in case one of them should be tempted to seek revenge
with a gun.'

We halted while the bearers cut up the slain yak and prepared the
meat for transport. Ah Sing and Lo Eng were superintending the work,
in their capacity of non-commissioned officers, and I heard them
haranguing the bearers in a style the very reverse of sympathetic.
They had learned how the hillmen deserted in the hour of danger, and
I anticipated that for the next few days those bearers would have a
thin time of it. But when Ah Sing came to me a few minutes afterwards,
there wasn't much of the bullying ganger about him. Instead, he looked
strangely uncomfortable.

'My no likum dis, Misser Mirlee,' he said, shaking his head. 'My long
time sabbee master him plenty stlong. Jus' now my tinkee him too muchee
stlong.'

'What gives you that impression, Ah Sing?' I said.

His voice took on a tone of awe. 'Jus' now my look-see dat piecee
yakkum,' he said, with his hand held edgewise to his own poll. 'Him
neckee bloke-um hab got!'

Deeper and deeper we plunged into the mountain fastnesses. It was clear
from the temperature our cooking water boiled at that we had risen
to a great altitude, and Poyning and I were already troubled with
height-sickness. Philipson concocted from his medicine chest a tonic
that quickly reduced the fever, but we still had great difficulty in
getting our breath in the rarefied air, and there was worse to come,
for our route lay far higher yet. Moreover, to advance had become a
matter of the utmost hardship. Whereas on the lower levels we had
climbed under clear skies, now the heavens were frequently clouded over
black from horizon to horizon, bringing fierce squalls of snow or hail,
and a biting wind was in our teeth all day, though calming down usually
at nightfall. Philipson was working towards the _obo_ very much as if
it were a point in the ocean and he a mariner steering a course to it;
he used his maps as a chart and checked our position by observations
whenever the sky cleared. The lie of the land necessitated constant
changes of direction, and sometimes we had even to deviate from
Philipson's former route, which, it will be remembered, he had followed
on foot; but never would our leader consent to leave the course laid
down on his maps unless it was physically impossible to get the ponies
along it. As it was, our journey took us up and down steeps which rise
in my mind to this hour like a ghastly dream--one of those nightmares
when you imagine yourself to be clinging fly-like to a vertical wall
at dizzy heights. But for the energy and skill and implacable resolve
of Saunders Philipson I am perfectly certain we should never have
got through at all, and even he couldn't prevent the ponies from
succumbing one by one to the tremendous work on scant fodder. Also, two
of the _tagliks_ lost their lives in one day, slipping under their load
and falling down a deep ravine.

Worst of all, the _obo_ hadn't appeared, although by Philipson's
calculations we should have found it by now. Philipson kept up a
dogged confidence, but I could see that even he was getting uneasy. He
decided, before casting around, to push straight ahead for one more
day's march. This we did, and it was our worst day yet. Two ponies
dropped dead, and two of the remaining bearers disappeared--where, we
never discovered, though it is likely they lay down to the drowsy rest
from which there is no awakening, and were quietly left by their own
fellows. At last Philipson, who was on foot ahead, halted with a great
cry.

'This is the pass,' he shouted. 'The _obo_ is at the top end of it.'

But when we came to the place it was five or six feet deep in drifts,
and nobody short of a diviner could have said whether the _obo_ was
there or not. It was too late to investigate now: dark was coming on.
We retreated down the rugged slope and pitched camp.

That night our thermometer went down to five degrees below zero, but
the morning rose clear, with the warmest sun we had known for a week
past. The whole party set to work digging, with any tool that came to
hand, but it was to the sun we owed our discovery. Brisk runnels of
water began to tinkle away down the slope, the face of the snow sagged
and caved, until there appeared, fully thirty yards from the scene of
our blind efforts, a curious green blotch against the white. Philipson
ploughed through the soggy mess towards it with a whoop of exultation,
and a moment later the three of us were dancing round the _obo_,
cheering like schoolboys. There was no doubt about it being the one we
sought: you could see plainly the zigzag scratches where Philipson had
scraped off the dead man's message.

We were now in a regular fury to be gone. Perhaps not two days off was
the end of our quest, the rim of that mysterious depression we had come
so far to find. Philipson at once laid out his compass and set a course
due west; but at that moment I observed a strange commotion among the
bearers. They were gathered in a group at some distance from where we
stood, and I saw one of them point to the sky with an expression of
downright terror. Excited as I was, I half expected to see one of the
monstrous birds of the legend flap out over the peak surrounding us,
but it wasn't that. It was a black cloud, no bigger than the cloud of
holy writ, but curiously distinct from anything I had ever seen before.
It was expanding swiftly under our eyes, and looked, on a gigantic
scale, exactly like a big blob of ink that has fallen on to a blotter.
But the really astonishing thing about it was the speed with which it
was approaching.

'Great Scott!' gasped Poyning. 'It's coming up as fast as a train!'

If I hadn't seen this type of cloud before, Philipson evidently had,
and recognised it for something dangerous. He instantly ordered the
tents, which had just been taken down, to be opened out and erected
again length-wise--one wall of canvas five or six-fold and about six
yards long. Every rope and peg we possessed we used to secure this one
shelter, and concentrated our whole camp under the lee of it. These
preparations were rushed through, but none too soon. With a shriek the
storm was upon us, first a terrific blast of wind, then a withering
burst of hail, then thunder; and after a while, when the very snow was
scoured off the barren steeps by the force of the tempest, blinding
clouds of sand and grit that stung the skin like spirts of flame. It
was a brand of storm, as I say, new to my acquaintance, and even in the
rush and howl of it all I couldn't help noticing with astonishment that
although the thunder crashed like the splitting asunder of mountains,
we saw from first to last no sign of lightning.

We crouched under the barrier, European and native alike, and I wasn't
long in seeing the point of lumping all our canvas together. Any one
tent by itself would have gone whirling on the wings of the storm, but
this reinforced wall, though the canvas bulged as if it would split and
the poles bent like reeds in a current, held; and after withstanding
its first fury, gathered strength from the storm itself. Snow and sand
banked up against it, forming a drift some seven feet high, behind
which, so long as the wind kept to the one quarter, we could laugh at
it.

The storm didn't rise. Nor did it abate. When once the thunder had
passed, which was about an hour after the first squall, the wind
settled down to blow steadily, gale-strong, through the night. And that
was a night of horror. By what I judge to have been ten o'clock we were
as near frozen to death as men can be and still live, for the canvas
wall, though a capital bulwark against the wind, was of little efficacy
against the cold. Our thickest blankets might have been summer muslins.
Then once more we had reason to bless Philipson's uncanny foresight.
He had insisted on adding the yak-hide to our gear, though I remember
thinking at the time that it was folly to burden ourselves with a thing
of such weight; now I knew that the foolishness had been mine. As soon
as the storm burst we had given our one remaining pony the yak-hide for
a rug. The poor beast whinnied pitifully when we took it off him, but
it was his life or ours. Philipson, Poyning and myself got into the
great woolly hide, turned inside out--it was ample to hold the three of
us--and slept in fair warmth.

At last there came a little lightening of the dense gloom, which having
reckoned to be daybreak, we rose to take stock of our situation. The
pony was dead, as we knew he must be, frozen stiff and hard as iron.
The Chinese servants and the bearers all appeared to have survived
the night without frostbite; they had pooled their sheepskins and
rolled themselves into one composite knot of humanity, which, in the
circumstances, was about the wisest thing they could have done. The
storm was still blowing great guns, and even by that mirky light we
could see an alarming change in the face of the mountain; nothing but
lumpy drifts everywhere, and every crevasse filled with treacherous,
powdery snow. Worst and crowning disaster, our chronometer and watches
were ruined. The all-penetrating dust which had been swirling in eddies
and back-washes behind our shelter all night had not only filled our
eyes and ears and mouths; it had got into every piece of clockwork we
possessed. In future we should be reduced to guessing time from the
sun, if visible, and our position in a land as unmapped as the ocean,
by the roughest of dead-reckoning from distance travelled.

The wind fell about mid-day, letting down a brisk fall of snow for
some three hours; then the sky cleared, and we were shown the full
direness of our calamity. Advance or retreat was out of the question
till the snow thinned, and we set about pitching a camp in the normal
pattern--pulling down our canvas wall and resolving it into three
tents. This kept us busy till dark. An atmosphere of utter dejection
was everywhere, which even Philipson's dogged energy an
